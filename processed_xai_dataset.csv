"The United States Geological Survey, a U.S. government agency responsible for analyzing geological activity, recently announced that it's using Twitter to help monitor earthquakes. The initiative is an innovative way to collect real-time information and improve understanding and response to these devastating natural phenomena. The project, called Twitter Earthquake Dispatch, was developed in 2009 as a way to explore the potential of the social media platform to provide up-to-date information about earthquakes around the world. Today, over 500 million people use Twitter, making it a rich source of real-time data and information. TED uses sophisticated algorithms to filter and analyze real-time tweets that contain earthquake-specific keywords like ""terrestrial,"" ""earthquake,"" and ""seismic."" Analysis of these tweets allows the USGS to quickly identify the location, intensity and time of the tweets. ",machine_translated

We have just logged 3,000 miles from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, crisscrossing back and forth across the world's 10th-longest border 22 times over two weeks and blogging about the experience. We have traversed the terrain through which President Donald Trump would build a 30-foot-high wall; we have talked to anyone and everyone who was willing to open up to us. We've seen a father and daughter speak through the bars of the border fence, and talked to an Arizona rancher who supports the wall but who has installed taps at every well on his desert property so migrants can drink. In Ciudad Juarez, we watched Mexican children throw rocks across the fence at railroad maintenance vehicles in the U.S. In Tijuana, we met a U.S. Army veteran who crossed the border, in her words, to ""hide'' from life for a few hours. What we've found, from the near-empty migrant shelters of Tamaulipas state in Mexico to the drug-running corridors of the Sonoran desert, is a region convulsed by uncertainty and angst, but rooted in a shared culture and history unlikely to be transformed by any politician, or any barrier man can construct. Border life ""is not going to change,'' said Ramon Alberto Orrantia, a 54-year-old restaurant parking attendant who has lived in Tijuana for 48 years. ""People continue doing the same thing.

"Antibiotic-resistant superbugs are a growing threat to global public health. According to a recent report, in 2050, one person will die every three seconds from infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria available.

"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has suggested that Japan should release the contaminated water stored at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea. The suggestion comes as a result of increasing concerns over the limited storage space available for the radioactive water, and the feasibility of continuing to store it indefinitely.Since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused a major nuclear meltdown at the plant, an estimated 1.25 million tons of radioactive water have been stored in more than 1,000 tanks on the site. The water has been used to cool the reactors and has been treated to remove most radioactive elements, but the element tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, remains difficult to remove.In an interview with Japanese media, Grossi said that releasing the water into the sea is a ""standard practice"" in the nuclear industry and poses a minimal risk to human health and the environment.

"In a surprise move, the US Senate has voted down a controversial oil pipeline that has been a hot topic of debate for years. The proposed pipeline, called Keystone XL, would have transported crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast of the United States.The vote came after days of intense lobbying by environmental groups, who argued that the pipeline would have serious consequences for the environment. They pointed to the fact that the pipeline would cross sensitive areas such as the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water to millions of Americans.Proponents of the pipeline, including many Republicans, argued that the project would create jobs and promote energy independence. However, the Senate ultimately decided to reject the pipeline, citing concerns about its environmental impact.The vote is a major victory for environmentalists, who have been fighting against the pipeline for years. However, it is important to note that the fight is not over yet. The Senate vote is merely a temporary setback, and the pipeline could still be approved in the future.The White House has yet to make a final decision on the pipeline, but President Obama has indicated that he is unlikely to approve it. The Obama administration has been taking a hard line on climate change, and the pipeline has become a symbol of the battle between environmentalists and those who support the fossil fuel industry.Despite the Senate vote, the issue is far from settled.

Since early November, the French government has imposed tougher restrictions on the rigorous confinement in March and April, with the aim of minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic.

The main problem is that the French population seems to be interpreting the new rules as a return to normalcy, with many people taking back trips and other habits that increase the risk of transmission of the virus.

"In an effort to stimulate the European economy and combat deflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced its plans to purchase government bonds. The decision comes as a response to the growing concerns over the potential stagnation of economic growth and the risk of deflation in the Eurozone.The bond-buying program, also known as quantitative easing, will involve the ECB purchasing bonds from Eurozone member countries, injecting billions of euros into the economy. This move is expected to lower borrowing costs for governments and businesses, and ultimately encourage spending and investment, thereby promoting economic growth.The exact amount and duration of the bond purchases have not been disclosed yet, but experts predict that the ECB could spend around €50 billion a month, totaling up to €1 trillion. The purchases will likely focus on longer-term bonds, those with maturities of ten years or more, aiming to lower long-term interest rates.ECB President Christine Lagarde, who has been vocal about her concerns regarding the slow economic recovery, stated that the bank's governing council was ready to expand or adjust the size, duration, and composition of the bond purchases, depending on the economic situation.The decision follows the footsteps of other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have already implemented similar quantitative easing programs.

"The White House is reportedly considering a plan to transfer migrants, who have crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, to sanctuary cities. The move is an attempt to address the increasing number of immigrants entering the country, while also targeting cities that have adopted policies to protect undocumented individuals.Sanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and New York, are jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. These cities have declared their intention to provide a safe haven for migrants, refusing to share information about undocumented residents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or assist in deportations.The idea of relocating migrants to sanctuary cities was first proposed by administration officials in November 2018, after President Trump threatened to cut off federal funding to these jurisdictions. The proposal was reportedly met with mixed reactions within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with some officials raising concerns over the legal, practical, and political implications of such a move.The possible transfer of migrants to sanctuary cities is seen by critics as a political move by the administration to punish those cities that have defied the president's immigration policies. However, the administration insists that the plan is intended to alleviate the overcrowding of detention facilities near the border.According to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, the proposal is one of many options being explored to address the current crisis at the US-Mexico border. The number of migrants attempting to cross the border has surged in recent months, with border patrol agents apprehending over 100,000 individuals in March alone.Proponents of the plan argue that transferring migrants to sanctuary cities could provide relief to communities already struggling to accommodate the influx of immigrants, while also sending a message to cities that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.However, opponents argue that the proposal could further strain local resources and potentially create tension within communities. Some mayors of sanctuary cities have already voiced their concerns over the potential influx of migrants.In response to the proposal, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, ""This is just another example of the Trump administration playing politics with people's lives. We should be focused on real solutions to our immigration challenges, not using migrants as pawns in a political game.""As the White House continues to weigh its options, it remains unclear whether the administration will move forward with the proposal to transfer migrants to sanctuary cities. In the meantime, communities across the country continue to grapple with the challenges of housing, educating, and integrating an increasing number of immigrants.",ai_generated
"In a shocking revelation, recent investigations have uncovered a multitude of child sex abuse cases within the military that have been shielded by an opaque military justice system. This disheartening discovery has raised serious concerns about the accountability and transparency of the military legal system.Victims and advocates have long claimed that the military's handling of sexual assault cases has been marred by a culture of secrecy and an inclination to protect perpetrators at the expense of survivors. The investigations conducted by various media outlets reveal that the problem is far more entrenched and widespread than previously acknowledged.According to these investigations, the military justice system has a long history of allowing sexual predators to escape punishment by utilizing loopholes and obscure procedures. As a result, the perpetrators have been able to continue their careers, often in high-ranking positions, with little to no consequences.Data obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests has shown that thousands of child sex abuse allegations have been reported within the military community, involving both service members and family members. The numbers reveal that the military has a disproportionate rate of child sex abuse cases when compared to the civilian population, yet convictions remain minimal.Moreover, the military's opaque legal system, coupled with a lack of public records, makes it difficult to accurately track these cases and hold the offenders accountable. For instance, the military's closed court-martial records do not provide case details, which leads to inadequate reporting and public oversight.Survivors of child sexual abuse in military families face additional barriers when seeking justice and support. These families are often stationed far away from their support networks and can struggle to access adequate resources. Additionally, military families are frequently relocated, which can lead to the loss of essential evidence and witnesses, thereby weakening the cases against perpetrators.In light of these revelations, calls have been growing to reform the military justice system to ensure better protection for child sexual abuse victims. Advocates argue that several changes are needed, such as increased transparency in court-martial proceedings and the implementation of a comprehensive reporting system.Furthermore, some suggest that the military should adopt the civilian legal system's practice of mandatory reporting of child sex abuse allegations, which would require mandatory training for all service members on recognizing and reporting abuse.The recent investigations have sparked a renewed public outcry for justice and the need for a systematic overhaul of the military justice system to protect the most vulnerable. It remains to be seen whether these findings will prompt long-awaited reforms and bring much-needed accountability and transparency to the military community.",ai_generated

"The devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on economies around the world is well-documented, and African countries have not been spared. Experts are increasingly calling for massive support to help African economies weather the COVID-19 storm, as the continent grapples with both economic and health challenges.A new report published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) highlights the devastating economic consequences of the pandemic on the African continent. According to the report, Africa's GDP is expected to contract by at least 1.4% in 2020, and up to 4.5% under a worst-case scenario. This economic contraction is expected to plunge an additional 27 million people into extreme poverty, reversing the progress made in the fight against poverty in recent years.As African countries impose lockdowns and restrict movement in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, economic activity has been significantly disrupted. This has led to job losses and reduced income for millions of people, particularly those working in the informal sector who have no safety net.In response to the pandemic, African governments have introduced stimulus packages to support vulnerable households and businesses. However, these measures are often limited in scope and scale due to the continent's limited fiscal space, high levels of public debt, and limited access to international financial markets. This makes it difficult for African governments to mobilize the resources needed to tackle the pandemic effectively.To address these challenges, experts are calling for more significant support from the international community. This includes debt relief, increased development aid, and access to concessional financing, particularly for the most vulnerable countries.""The African continent needs substantial support to manage the impacts of the pandemic,"" said Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of UNECA. ""Debt relief measures and increased development aid are crucial in providing the much-needed fiscal space for African countries to respond to the crisis.""One such measure that has been proposed is the issuance of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which would provide additional liquidity for African countries. The IMF has also approved a $10 billion debt service relief for some of the continent's poorest nations.While these measures are a step in the right direction, experts argue that they are not enough to meet the continent's needs. ""These measures are merely a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the challenge facing African countries,"" said Carlos Lopes, former Executive Secretary of UNECA.",ai_generated

"Yemen is an incredibly complex country, with a unique tribal system that contributes to the country's deepening conflict. Divided into hundreds of small tribal groups, Yemen is a nation of ancient tribal loyalties. Tribal identity can determine loyalties to different factions in the current civil war, with some of Yemen's population allying themselves to the Houthi rebels and others with the government. The presence of tribal forces has led to a more entrenched and violent conflict, as local groups battle for control of certain regions. This tribal system has long been present in Yemen and, in some cases, can be used to maintain a semblance of peace between rival factions. However, as the current conflict intensifies, loyalties between tribes become increasingly important and different political factions can use tribal ties to their own advantage. Consequently, this has caused further violence and disruption across the country.Yemeni leaders have proposed several approaches to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, but for the moment, the tribal system remains an obstacle to any potential peace. By understanding this unique system and its role in the ongoing conflict, international actors can be better placed to help mediate a peaceful solution.

A person familiar with the matter stated, ""The president has repeatedly said that it would be better if we could get along with Russia. He sees a big summit with Putin as a way to accomplish that.""Trump's advisers, on the other hand, are concerned that a meeting with Putin could be a high-risk move, with some fearing that it could be perceived as a sign of weakness. Many are still dealing with the aftermath of the Helsinki summit in 2018, which saw Trump face harsh criticism for appearing to side with Putin over US intelligence agencies on the matter of Russian election interference.Moreover, experts and analysts are worried that Trump's eagerness for a meeting with Putin may overshadow important issues like the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the unresolved issue of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections. The upcoming US elections in November have further heightened concerns about the potential for renewed Russian interference.A former White House official who wished to remain anonymous said, ""We can't ignore the fact that Russia is a major player in the international arena, but it's important to be cautious and strategic when dealing with Putin. We need to ensure that we are not overlooking key issues in favor of a big summit.""Amid these concerns, it is still unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Putin will actually take place.

"Cuba has softened a new law on artistic expression, ending fears that it could further restrict creative freedoms on the island.The new law, which was passed in July, sought to prevent certain forms of artistic expression from being deemed ""counterrevolutionary"" and suppress criticism of the government. It attracted criticism from human rights groups, which feared it could be used as a tool to further stifle freedom of expression in Cuba.However, the government has now amended the law to ensure that criticism of the government is allowed, provided it is “done in a respectful manner”. It has also extended an amnesty to those charged under the law since July.Cuban Deputy Culture Minister Fernando Rojas said the changes show the government’s “openness and respect for creators who express themselves freely”.The move has been welcomed by human rights groups, who have cautiously hailed it as a step in the right direction.The amended law comes as the Cuban government has implemented a series of economic reforms in recent years, including the easing of foreign investment rules and the liberalization of certain sectors of the economy. It remains to be seen if these economic reforms will have an impact on freedom of expression in the country.",ai_generated
"Tigray, the northernmost region of Ethiopia, has become a ""battleground state"" in recent months, with growing tensions between ethnic groups causing concern among local leaders and the government.Tigray, which is home to the majority of Ethiopia's ethnic Tigrinya community, has a long history of ethnic tensions. However, recent political changes in the region and across Ethiopia have led to an escalation of these tensions, with various ethnic groups vying for power and influence.In particular, there has been a growing rift between the Tigrinya and the neighboring Welkait community, which is predominantly ethnic Amhara. This has led to violent clashes and displacement of people in the region, causing widespread concern among local leaders and the government.The situation in Tigray is not unique, however. Ethiopia is a diverse country, with over 80 ethnic groups spread throughout its provinces. As such, tensions between different ethnic groups are not uncommon. However, the recent political changes in the country have led to a rise in these tensions, with various groups vying for power and influence in the post-Authoritarian era.The government has been working to address these tensions, with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launching a national reconciliation project to promote dialogue and understanding between different ethnic groups. However, much work remains to be done, and the situation in Tigray is a reminder of the challenges that Ethiopia faces in ensuring peace and stability in the post-authoritarian era.",ai_generated

"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, known as COPD, is a life-threatening illness commonly brought on by years of smoking. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 200 million people have been diagnosed with the illness, and that most live in low- and middle-income countries. While it isn't curable, patients' lives can be extended with treatment such as steroids. A new study shows that low doses of the medicine given by mouth are equal to, or better than, a heavy dose administered intravenously. Meet Dr. Francis Welch, a retired dentist and now a patient diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. He is paying the price for years of smoking. ""I have to think about breathing 60 minutes of every hour. It's a heck of a nuisance,"" he says.Because COPD is an ailment that blocks airflow in the lungs, it is critical that COPD patients often focus on breathing, exercise regularly and learn relaxation techniques, especially when they are short of breath. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease stems from emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as asthmatic bronchitis. Other symptoms include wheezing, a chronic cough producing yellow mucous, and frequent respiratory infections.The most common cause of COPD is long-term smoking or years of exposure to second-hand smoke. Miners and workers in chemical industries also are vulnerable because of their exposure to dust, harmful chemicals and fumes. Doctors say the damage brought on by these conditions eventually interrupts the natural exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. When those conditions worsen, doctors often treat patients with steroids.Dr.",human

"While political parties in the United States other than the Democratic and Republican have fielded presidential candidates for years, they have never won the White House. VOA's Jeffrey Young explores how these third party candidates have nonetheless influenced the outcome of elections.In 1992, Democratic Party presidential candidate Bill Clinton defeated the incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush, the father of President George W. Bush, by nearly six million votes. But a so-called third party candidate, Ross Perot, received almost 20 million votes. Many political observers say the votes cast for Perot clearly affected the outcome of the contest between Mr. Bush and Mr.Clinton.The United States has two major political parties, the Democratic and the Republican. But there are others, such as the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Socialist Party. These and other third parties have never succeeded in winning the White House. The reason for that is the structure of the Electoral College that actually selects the president.Benjamin Ginsberg at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. says, ""We don't actually have one national election. We have 50 statewide [presidential] elections that are held on the same day. And in each state, Electoral College votes are allocated, usually to the candidate that wins the most votes in that state.""Ralph Nader ran under the Green Party banner in 1996 and 2000 and also ran unaffiliated in 2004.

"Iran has filed a lawsuit against the United States alleging that Washington's decision in May to impose sanctions after pulling out of a nuclear deal violates a 1955 treaty between the two countries, the International Court of Justice said Tuesday.A State Department official said the application was without merit and the United States would fight it in the court.""While we cannot comment on the specifics, Iran's application is baseless and we intend to vigorously defend the United States before the ICJ,"" a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran reached by his predecessor Barack Obama and other world powers, and ordered tough U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Under the 2015 deal, which Trump sees as flawed, Iran reined in its disputed nuclear program under U.N. monitoring and won a removal of international sanctions in return.The ICJ, which is based in The Hague and is also known as the World Court, is the United Nations tribunal for resolving international disputes.

"The tourist-dependent island of Bali has suffered a new blow just after having recovered from a devastating terrorist bombing in 2002. Saturday's bombings again targeted tourist areas, this time killing at least 25 people. Politicians and business people are at odds over what effect the latest bombings will have on Bali's - and Indonesia's - economy.Bali's tourism industry has been slowly but steadily recovering from the devastating bombings in October 2002 that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. Last year, two years after the attack, Bali set a new all-time record of 1.5 million visitors.Saturday's bombings, which killed at least 25 more, threaten to reverse those gains. Some officials, like Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, have already predicted that the latest bombings will be ""devastating for tourism in Bali"" and that it will take ""years to rebuild out of this.""But others, tourism experts and economists, predict that this time, the impact on Bali's economy will be more limited.Song Sen Wun, a regional economist with G.K.

"In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has announced plans to lift a ban on year-round sales of gasoline with high-ethanol content, a decision that is expected to benefit American farmers and the ethanol industry.Currently, the sale of gasoline containing 15% ethanol, or E15, is prohibited between June 1 and September 15 in some areas of the United States. This ban, which aims to reduce smog levels in the summer months, will be lifted under the new policy. Trump's decision will allow fuel stations to sell E15 throughout the year, which could lead to higher ethanol production and increased demand for corn, the primary feedstock for ethanol in the US.The decision comes as a response to the growing pressure from the US corn belt, particularly from the states of Iowa and Nebraska, which are the largest ethanol and corn producers in the country. The move is seen as an effort by Trump to garner support from the farming communities ahead of the midterm elections in November.The year-round sales of E15 are expected to increase ethanol consumption by up to 2 billion gallons annually, according to Geoff Cooper, the CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. This increase in ethanol demand will provide a much-needed boost to the struggling agricultural sector, which has been hit hard by Trump's ongoing trade war with China.However, Trump's decision has faced criticism from the oil industry, which has long opposed the higher ethanol blending. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has argued that the decision could result in higher gasoline prices for consumers and damage vehicle engines not designed for higher ethanol levels.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is now set to start the process of lifting the ban, which could take several months due to the required regulatory steps. This means that the year-round sales of E15 could potentially start by the summer of 2019.In conclusion, Trump's decision to lift the ban on E15 gasoline sales is a significant step for the American ethanol industry, and it has been largely welcomed by farmers in the corn belt. However, it remains to be seen how this policy shift will play out in terms of environmental concerns and the ongoing tensions between the ethanol and oil industries.",ai_generated

", Says WHOMoses EmetiThe recent news report that the West Africa region has recorded an outbreak of a highly transmissible and potent Ebola virus strain in Guinea is not news to many Africans. The news was reported at the time to inform and educate. But what has become of that knowledge, other than fear and confusion?Although Ebola was declared over in Guinea in November 2014, it is still present and is still devastatingly lethal.Despite this fact, there has been little information released to inform Africans who are at risk to the disease or to raise awareness about prevention and treatment.The World Health Organisation has since called for more information to better understand the situation.At a global level, it is clear that there is still much that can be done to prevent or reduce spread of Ebola from the Ebola epidemic in Africa. However, what is equally clear, is that in many parts of Africa, Ebola remains a significant health challenge.It is important to note that the emergence of Ebola in West Africa has highlighted the challenge of health response in the region, including where there is a significant burden of HIV. In 2015, the WHO recorded that the prevalence of HIV (1 in 5 males and 1 in 8 females) in the region was twice the estimated prevalence of malaria (1 in 5 females and 1 in 5 males). This was the first time in 20 years that HIV prevalence and malaria rates were higher than in western countries.Africans continue to be infected by HIV because of social and behavioural factors, including stigma and discrimination, high prevalence of HIV in rural areas, and limited treatment options.Globally, the number of people living with HIV has been declining rapidly since it reached a peak in 2012. There are 1.5 million people living with HIV globally, compared with almost 3.5 million in 2001. Globally, there are around 600,000 people who acquire HIV from their partners.Africans living with HIV in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa account for a significant proportion of HIV infection.",ai_generated

Four years ago, the United States nearly bombed the Syrian government, only to pull back when Assad agreed to give up his chemical arsenal and submit to U.N. inspections.After last week's attack, President Donald Trump fired U.S. cruise missiles at Syrian government targets for the first time.Remaining missile fragments from attacks in 2013 are shown in the Ghouta town of Ain Tarma, Syria, April 7, 2017.Survivors of the Ghouta attack four years ago never lost the fear they could be gassed again at any moment, said Amer Zaydan, a 28-year-old school director from another part of eastern Ghouta.

The strike was called by various trade unions in response to the government's austerity measures and rising living costs. As a result, transportation came to a standstill, with public transport vehicles remaining idle and flights being canceled. Schools, universities, and government offices were also affected, with many of them closing down due to the strike.The strike was largely peaceful, with no reports of violence or damage to property. However, it caused significant economic losses, with many businesses forced to shut down due to the lack of transportation and other disruptions. The government has condemned the strike and called on the unions to engage in dialogue to find a solution to the crisis.Tensions are already high in Argentina, which is grappling with a recession, high inflation, and a shortage of foreign currency.

He also acknowledged the importance of close cooperation with Afghanistan in achieving these objectives. ""Our aim is to create a secure and stable environment in the region. We will make every possible effort to curb terrorist activities and to cooperate with our Afghan brothers in this respect,"" said the President.This announcement comes at a crucial time as Afghanistan prepares for the first-ever democratic presidential elections scheduled for October 9. The recent surge in violence from the Taliban and other extremist groups has raised concerns about the safety and security of the electoral process.Afghan officials have repeatedly accused Pakistan of harboring and supporting terrorist groups that target Afghanistan. However, Pakistan has continually denied these allegations, stating that they are committed to working with Afghanistan and the international community to eliminate terrorism.During the meeting in New York City, President Musharraf is expected to hold talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, US President George W. Bush, and other regional leaders to discuss strategies for combating terrorism and fostering cooperation among the countries involved.Pakistan has already taken several steps to curb cross-border terrorism, including the deployment of over 70,000 troops along the Afghan border to conduct counter-terrorism operations. Additionally, Pakistan has implemented strict border control measures, such as biometric systems, to ensure that only legal and verified individuals are allowed entry.President Musharraf's pledge comes as a reassuring sign of Pakistan's commitment to regional peace and stability.

"Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, has claimed that the Taliban's leadership is in disarray, citing internal divisions and a lack of clarity on the group's direction. In a recent interview, Qureshi raised concerns over the group's ability to stabilize Afghanistan, potentially hindering peace talks and progress in the war-torn country.Qureshi, in conversation with local media, highlighted the disunity and fractured leadership within the Taliban. According to him, the organization is now plagued with infighting, with rival factions vying for power and control over the group's operations. This has led to confusion and a lack of consensus on how to move forward in Afghanistan.The Foreign Minister's comments come amid the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan, a move that has led to a surge in violence and instability in the country. It is feared that the Taliban could exploit this chaos, potentially returning to power in Afghanistan and reversing the progress made in the last two decades.Qureshi's claims seem to be supported by recent events, with reports of internal clashes among the Taliban, resulting in casualties on both sides. Furthermore, the group has failed to present a unified front during peace talks with the Afghan government, causing concerns over the prospect of a lasting peace agreement.The disarray within the Taliban has also attracted attention from the international community. The United States, the European Union, and other key stakeholders have expressed concerns about the group's intentions and capacity to effectively govern if they were to seize power in Afghanistan.Pakistan has long been considered a key player in Afghanistan's future, with its influence on the Taliban seen as crucial to the peace process. Qureshi's acknowledgment of the Taliban's discord could potentially serve as a signal to the group to address their internal issues and come together for the sake of peace in the region.In conclusion, the Taliban's current disarray raises concerns about the group's ability to negotiate effectively and contribute to the stabilization of Afghanistan. As a central player in the region, Pakistan has a vested interest in seeing peace and stability prevail. This puts increased pressure on the Taliban to quell their internal divisions and present a united front in the ongoing peace negotiations.",ai_generated

But Trump's infrastructure plan is silent on the looming problem, an administration official familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the plan and spoke on condition of anonymity.Fulfilling a campaign promise, Trump's plan proposes to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years.

The children of these people may have similar symptoms, even though they've never had similar experiences before, but it's important to note that traumatic inheritance is not inevitable. There are ways to reduce the likelihood of transmission of trauma to our children, such as seeking professional help to deal with distress and anxiety.

"Iraqi President Barham Salih has called upon the United Nations (UN) member states to remove the remaining sanctions imposed on his country during the era of former leader Saddam Hussein. In a virtual address to the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 23, Salih emphasized that Iraq has transformed significantly since the fall of Saddam's regime and that the continued sanctions impede the nation's progress.The Iraqi President highlighted his country's achievements in establishing a democratic political system, combating terrorism, and contributing to regional stability. He also praised the role of the UN in supporting Iraq's development and assisting in its efforts to overcome the numerous challenges that have arisen since 2003.Saddam-era sanctions were first imposed on Iraq in August 1990 following the country's invasion of Kuwait. The international community introduced comprehensive economic sanctions, arms embargoes, and restrictions on the trade of petroleum products under UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Though most of these sanctions were lifted following the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam's government, some remain in place.One such remaining sanction is the oil-for-food program, which was initially established in 1995 to help Iraq sell its oil in exchange for humanitarian goods such as food and medicine. Despite the regime change, Iraq is still required to deposit a percentage of its oil revenues into a compensation fund under UN administration. As a result, Iraq is unable to access the full revenue generated from its oil exports, limiting its capacity to finance infrastructure and social welfare projects.During his speech, Salih also addressed the issue of Iraq's foreign debt, urging the international community to take steps to reduce the debt burden. Iraq currently has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, with much of the debt dating back to the Saddam-era and the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. The President emphasized that alleviating the debt will allow the nation to invest further in its economic recovery and strengthen its institutions.In addition to the economic challenges, Iraq is grappling with political instability and ongoing security threats from extremist groups, such as the Islamic State (ISIS).

Mohamed, who was later elected a second term, claimed to have been elected for a six-year term, but in reality has only been in office for about a year. This uncertainty has led to a political impasse between Mohamed's government and the opposition, which is allied with the Federal National Congress. The two groups have not been able to come to a deal, and there has been no government in place since March 2020.The situation, however, appears to be better than it was during Mohamed's first term in office, which coincided with the brutal years of fighting between the militant Al Shabaab and the Ethiopian military and AMISOM troops. The latter operations were the cause of Somalia's near-complete collapse in 2001-2002.""There is very little money,"" one aid worker in Somalia told VOA, adding that some aid donors are struggling to come to Somalia.""We are struggling to fund everything that is needed to ensure humanitarian needs can be met.",ai_generated

Their idea: to make a frame from pieces of bamboo held together with a coarse fiber called sisal. Fixed to the frames are wheels, pedals and handlebars.The plan is to manufacture the bike frames in developing countries and send them to Europe and the United States where they will be finished and sold.With the help of designer Craig Calfree, a team of 25 young Zambian men are being trained to build the bikes.Project manager Chiteu Muyoya said the advantage of a bamboo bicycle is that it can absorb vibrations and shocks like bumps in the road, making it comfortable to ride over long distances.

"The world's most wanted drug lord, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, is behind bars after Mexican and U.S. agents captured him Saturday at a hotel in the Mexican resort of Mazatlan. Agents had been tracking Guzman for weeks after Mexican police arrested other top members of his Sinaloa drug cartel. They believe Guzman had been able to avoid capture through a series of hideouts and escape tunnels before arresting him without a shot being fired. Guzman is wanted in the United States on a number of charges including smuggling tons of cocaine, marijuana, and heroin across the Mexican border. His Sinaloa drug cartel stretches across North America and as far away as Europe and Australia. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder calls Guzman's arrest a victory for U.S. and Mexican citizens. He says the criminal activity Guzman has allegedly directed contributed to the deaths and destruction of millions of people through drug addiction, violence and corruption. The Sinaloa cartel has been at the center of a bloody turf war with other cartels over drug trafficking routes in northern Mexico. About 80,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since the early 2000's, including murders and beheadings. Former president Felipe Calderon sent in the army to try and quell the violence. Forbes magazine lists Guzman among the world's most powerful people, saying he is worth more than $1 billion.",human

"Guinea's interim Prime Minister, Mohamed Beavogui, has declared that he is not bound by the transitional government deal, causing concerns that the country's path towards elections and a return to civilian rule may be jeopardized. Beavogui, who was appointed by coup leader Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, insisted that he was under no obligation to follow any pre-existing agreements made with opposition groups.The transitional government deal in question was negotiated between the ousted President Alpha Condé's government and opposition groups last year. The agreement aimed to pave the way for a unity government, which would create a more inclusive political environment and put an end to years of political unrest in Guinea.However, the recent coup on September 5th led by Colonel Doumbouya and the subsequent suspension of the constitution have left the future of Guinea's political landscape uncertain. Doumbouya has claimed that the coup was necessary to end corruption and mismanagement under Condé's rule, but concerns have been raised about the military's ability to lead the country towards a democratic future.Beavogui's comments have not been well received by opposition leaders, who fear that this could signal a lack of commitment to the transitional government deal and could potentially lead to further instability. In response, the opposition parties have demanded a clear roadmap for the country's transition, as well as guarantees for their participation in the unity government.The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the international community have been closely monitoring the situation in Guinea. In the wake of the coup, they have called for the immediate release of President Condé, the restoration of the constitution, and a swift return to civilian rule.

"TAIPEI - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys widespread popular support nearly a year into his deadly anti-crime campaign, despite a wall of criticism from abroad over suspected extrajudicial killings.Eighty percent of Filipinos surveyed in the first quarter of this year placed “much trust” in Duterte, who took office in June on pledges to eradicate crime, especially illegal drugs. The Manila-based research institution Social Weather Stations says the president has received an “excellent” rating in surveys for four quarters. Fellow survey agency Pulse Asia found in March that 79 percent of people polled “approve” of the government’s effort to control crime.Filipinos often say they feel safer now compared to the period before Duterte, former mayor of the country’s second largest city, took office.

Among his major works are ""The Complete Sonatas,"" ""The Ancient Sonatas,"" and ""The Poems of Anther."" He was one of the foremost figures in the intellectual movement.",machine_translated
"Burundi's Independent National Electoral Commissioner, Joseph Kaburahe, has recently warned that free press coverage of the 2020 Presidential Election must be restricted in order to ensure its credibility. Mr. Kaburahe stated that a free press could create divisions and confusion in an already sensitive environment. In order to make sure that the election is fair and open to all political candidates, he asserted that the media must be kept at a distance. He said that there was a risk that the media could be used as a weapon to influence the election, and that the press must be restricted from the election until after it is complete. Mr. Kaburahe also emphasized that any attempt to manipulate the result of the election by the media would not be tolerated. His comments are an indication of the Burundian government's increasing concern about the role that the media might play in the upcoming election, and highlights the dangers of an unchecked media presence during such a sensitive period.",ai_generated

"in Conflict Zones(Bloomberg) — The World Food Program was lauded by a United Nations panel for its response to Covid-19, but the next leader of the U.N.’s largest humanitarian agency will also need to tackle hunger crises from Syria to South Sudan.The program must “urgently increase its focus on conflict and hunger-torn countries,” a panel of seven independent experts said in a report. The group’s recommendations come after a year of coronavirus disruptions that led to global food-insecurity levels reaching the highest point since World War II.The WFP feeds 97 million people around the world and spent $8.6 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2020. In January, David Beasley, a Republican and the former governor of South Carolina, was elected to a second term as the head of the agency.The independent panel, in a statement Monday, said the WFP needs to focus on “immediate and critical situations” in order to maintain a balance between addressing chronic hunger and fighting the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It called on member states and donors to recognize the “emergency” nature of the situation and ensure “robust funding.”The WFP said in a statement to Bloomberg that it is on course to hit its target to cut the number of hungry people in half by 2030 as its work responding to the Covid crisis has shown the value of its services.“As we come out of this pandemic, we recognize that even more people need our help to put food on the table, and our mission remains critical,” Beasley said. “This mission is more important than ever, as conflict, economic shocks, and the ongoing Covid-19 crisis are pushing more people than ever before to the brink of starvation.”WFP Response to CovidBeasley’s leadership has been widely hailed, with the agency being praised by world leaders for its response to the Covid-19 crisis. For example, the WFP’s supply-chain expertise allowed the UN to ensure its procurement and logistics networks could continue operating and that vaccines reached remote communities.Beasley has also been credited with maintaining the WFP’s focus on the plight of the world’s hungriest people while raising its profile.",ai_generated

The government plans to place these children with foster families, government institutions, or residential care facilities to provide them with essential services and education.However, some experts argue that the move has created a “human rights crisis” by separating children from their families. Additionally, experts fear that the children will be taken away from their Uighur culture and traditions, and subjected to Chinese state propaganda.The government maintains that its policies are aimed at combatting terrorism and religious extremism in the region.

How about ""Why didn't they make Woodstock 2: Electric Boogaloo?"" Well, this is how I got my first question.I had just returned from vacation, and at the airport in San Francisco, I got lost at the gate and had to wait a while. I was pretty hungry, and when a cop finally found me, I was pretty excited that he was going to eat with me. I kept thinking about how Woodstock '99 has changed the world, and my own life, and how important this was. It was the first of many conversations with people that I was fortunate enough to meet or interview, and it was during these interactions that I first encountered music — both in concerts and through recordings.There was a lot of information to gather. I decided to record and post on a website, where I knew people would be able to read it. This was back before the Internet, which was a great help in keeping things organized and organized, and I had a lot of help with finding the music I needed and in finding my way to my destinations.I decided I would use a little of what I had gathered to create some videos, and as a first one, I decided to make one that would feature music I had heard at Woodstock, but that had never been on record until then. This is the first song I made that was meant to be an acoustic cover, and for that it was the perfect subject.As I was composing and editing the video for Woodstock, I decided to make a cover of ""Let's Stay Together"" by a local musician who had played at Woodstock: a guy from a small town in Mississippi. He had been interviewed by the paper, and was going to perform at Woodstock. I asked him, if he was going to play at my event, if he could sing at my event, and he said yes. It became a little bit more than that, and eventually he came out and recorded a version of the song. He did the first interview of what would become a big Woodstock anniversary series.For the rest of the videos, I made a lot of contact with artists I had interviewed.",ai_generated

"Over the past several years, Vietnam's communist government has relaxed restrictions on private business, religious activities and the media.

As Matt Steinglass reports from the city of Hue, it is a trade-off that many Vietnamese appear ready to accept.Hundreds of Catholics attend afternoon mass at the Church of the Redemptorist Fathers in Hue.Only a decade ago, many Vietnamese Catholics were careful about displaying their faith, concerned about running afoul of the ruling Communist Party.That has changed, however, as the government has become increasingly tolerant of religious activity. It also has loosened restrictions on the media and private enterprise.But the trial last week of Father Nguyen Van Ly makes clear that the government still considers political dissent unacceptable.At the end of the trial, Ly was sentenced to eight years in prison, and four associates received lighter sentences.They had published an independent newsletter and founded an alternative political party, the Progression Party. The government said they had violated laws against disseminating political propaganda against the Vietnamese state.The Catholic Church has been quiet about Ly's imprisonment - because it does not appear he was singled out for his religion.Father Joseph Le Viet Phuc explains that in principle, a priest should not engage in politics.

"As the United States gears up for the 2022 midterm elections, former President Donald Trump remains a dominant and highly polarizing figure within the Republican party. His leadership continues to create deep divisions within the GOP, with the party struggling to present a unified front in the face of a Democratic-controlled Congress and White House.Trump's influence on the party was once again put on full display during the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). In his first public appearance since leaving office, Trump clearly stated that he was not going to start a new political party, quashing rumors that he might seek to create a ""Patriot Party."" Instead, he declared his intention to consolidate power within the GOP, hinting at a potential 2024 presidential run and pledging to support like-minded candidates in the upcoming midterm elections.This show of support for the Republican party, however, has not bridged the significant ideological and strategic rifts among its members. Prominent GOP politicians, such as Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, have openly criticized Trump and his continued influence on the party, leading to a contentious debate over the GOP's direction. Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, recently said that he ""does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward,"" highlighting the ongoing feud between the anti-Trump and pro-Trump factions.On the other hand, many Republicans in Congress and statehouses across the country continue to embrace Trump's policies and rhetoric, hoping to capitalize on his enduring popularity among a significant portion of the party's base. This pro-Trump faction includes potential 2024 presidential hopefuls such as Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Ron DeSantis, who have not shied away from aligning themselves with Trump's legacy.In the lead-up to the midterm elections, this schism within the GOP has resulted in an increasingly fierce competition for endorsements and resources, as candidates from both factions vie for the support of donors, volunteers, and voters. This intraparty strife has raised concerns among some Republicans that it may ultimately weaken their chances of retaking control of Congress in 2022, as well as the White House in 2024.The GOP's deep internal divisions are further evidenced by the fact that Trump's approval ratings remain relatively high among self-identified Republicans, while a significant number of independents and Democrats view him unfavorably.",ai_generated

In a recent statement, President Tsai said, ""We call on the concerned parties to face the issues and join us in making the East China Sea a sea of peace and cooperation.""The President's call for peace came amid a tense situation between China and Japan, as both nations recently increased their military presence around the disputed islands. This has led to numerous encounters and near-collisions between the Chinese and Japanese navies, raising concerns over a potential armed conflict in the region.Taiwan, which also claims the disputed islands, has proposed a trilateral dialogue between China, Japan, and Taiwan to discuss the issues and explore avenues for peaceful coexistence. According to a statement from Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""The government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has consistently advocated for resolving disputes in the East China Sea through peaceful means and hopes to promote regional security and prosperity through dialogue and cooperation.""Taiwan's peacekeeper role proposal has received mixed reactions from both China and Japan. While China has not yet commented on the proposal, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato stated that Japan is open to dialogue but maintains its stance that the Senkaku Islands are under its sovereignty.However, some experts believe that Taiwan's peacekeeper role could potentially be beneficial in mitigating the escalating tensions. According to Yun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, ""Taiwan's proposal can help facilitate communication between China and Japan, and also prevent misperceptions and unintended escalation in the region.""If accepted, Taiwan's peacekeeper role could set a new precedent for peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, which has seen numerous conflicts in recent years. As a neutral party with a history of promoting dialogue and cooperation, Taiwan could be a critical player in resolving the East China Sea dispute and maintaining regional peace and stability.",ai_generated

"LIMA - A powerful magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck a remote part of the Amazon jungle in Peru early Sunday, collapsing buildings and knocking out power to some areas but causing only one reported death.The quake struck at 2:41 a.m. and was centered in a vast nature preserve 57 miles (92 kilometers) east of the small town of Yurimaguas. Helping limit damage was the earthquake's depth, at 70 miles (114 kilometers) below the surface, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Earthquakes that are close to the surface generally cause more destruction. President Martin Vizcarra called for calm before traveling to the zone with members of his Cabinet to survey the damage. He said first reports indicate a bridge had collapsed and several homes and roads had been affected. ""It's a quake that was felt throughout the Peruvian jungle,"" said Vizcarra, who was scheduled to host a regional summit Sunday in the capital with the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.Ricardo Seijas, chief of the National Emergency Operations Center, said one person died when a rock fell on a house in the Huarango district.",human
"In a move to prevent a potential federal shutdown, US lawmakers are considering a funding extension for the federal government as they continue to debate on the fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. The new fiscal year, which starts on October 1, requires Congress to pass a series of spending bills to keep the government running, but disagreements between Democrats and Republicans have hindered the timely approval of the appropriations bills.This potential federal shutdown looms over the country as it continues to grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of natural disasters. A shutdown would see a large number of federal services and employees furloughed, affecting millions of Americans and potentially derailing the nation's economic recovery.As a solution, lawmakers are reportedly discussing a temporary funding extension, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), which would keep the government funded at current levels for a designated period, giving Congress additional time to finalize the spending bills. This stopgap measure has been utilized in the past when the appropriations process has stalled due to political disagreements.However, a CR is not without its own issues, as it may hinder new projects, delay federal hiring, and prevent any adjustments to current funding levels in response to new challenges. Moreover, it could also lead to further fiscal uncertainty as Congress may continue to face gridlock when it comes to approving the spending bills.Despite these drawbacks, it remains a preferable option to a government shutdown, especially considering the current state of the nation. As such, key figures in both parties are expressing their willingness to cooperate and avoid a shutdown.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently stated that a short-term funding extension was a possibility, and added that he is ""working hard to avoid a shutdown."" Similarly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has mentioned that discussions on a CR are ongoing.On the Republican side, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) indicated that he is also open to a temporary funding extension, while emphasizing the need to address the current debt ceiling crisis, another pressing issue for Congress.The push for a funding extension comes as the clock ticks down for lawmakers, with less than two weeks left before the new fiscal year begins.",ai_generated

"An appeals court in Paris on Friday sentenced former defence minister Charles Pasqua to a one-year suspended jail sentence and an 80,000 euro ($106,000) fine for his role in an illegal 1993 arms deal with Angola.Pasqua, a powerful French conservative politician, had been convicted in the scandal on appeal in 2009 and fined but escaped jail after another appeals court in 2010 ordered a new trial on the grounds that there had been insufficient evidence.The case relates to the supply of 400 tanks and six boats to the Angolan government in the early 1990s as French and American-led UN peacekeepers were withdrawing from the former Portuguese colony.The delivery of the arms coincided with the visit to France of Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos in October 1993, while Pasqua was defence minister in a conservative coalition government.Although French officials told reporters at the time that the tanks were second-hand, it later emerged that they had in fact been built only a few months earlier, according to AFP reports at the time.Pasqua told Friday's hearing that the Angolan government would have bought the tanks elsewhere if France had not sold them. He described the arms deal as ""transparent, legal and in the strictest respect of public morality.""Two other defendants, businessman Pierre Falcone and his associate Arcadi Gaydamak, were convicted and handed two-year suspended sentences on Friday and fines of 300,000 and 100,000 euros respectively.Gaydamak and Falcone were convicted of conspiring to ""influence a foreign public agent"" and influence ""a person who was responsible for a public service.""",ai_generated
"In times of tragedy, social media can be both a unifier and a divider. In the wake of recent disasters, such as the hurricanes that ravaged the United States and the earthquake that shook Mexico, social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook have become essential tools in communicating news and raising funds.Through campaigns like #PrayforMexico and #HoustonStrong, social media has acted as a vehicle to spread awareness and build a sense of solidarity. Fundraisers set up on GoFundMe and other fundraising sites have helped to collect millions of dollars for victims, while many have used social media to offer shelters for those in need.But while social media can be used for good, it can also be used to sow discord. Many have used the sites to spread lies, rumors, and unfounded allegations. Furthermore, the comments that people make on social media have been known to have a polarizing effect.For many, however, social media is still seen as a source of comfort during times of tragedy. Through it, victims are not only connected with those who can help, but also with the support they need to cope with difficult times.

"As part of their ongoing maritime dispute with Kenya, Somali pirates have used their ships to attack the UN shipping lanes. It is not just the UN which is threatened by piracy: the Somali government and maritime industry is vulnerable to attack by pirates or other external entities, including armed groups.The UN’s Office of Law of the Sea (UNOLS) is a major global player in the field of maritime safety, regulation, and coordination. But as a “governing body” of the UN system, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Security Council, which is a powerful military, political and bureaucratic institution with the ability to enforce its own rules. The UNOLS is responsible for making sure there is “regular, systematic, regular, and independent inspection of all vessels and other maritime traffic in UN waters”.When it comes to piracy, the law of the sea does not actually set the standard. The UNOLS’ responsibility is the control of ships on the high seas – the seas that are subject to the UN’s jurisdiction. So if Somalia has attacked the high seas, the UNOLS is bound to respond to it.The law of the sea does not set the standard. The UNOLS “set the standard” by ensuring there is regular and systematic international review of all high seas vessels. And that there is an “independent agency” (like the OSI) to determine whether ships have been attacked.However, the UNOLS does not “set the standard” for the pirates they oversee. The UNOLS is “the global legal authority” in the high seas. It must have the ability and the power to stop attacks. This is why “international security cooperation” is necessary for the Somali pirates to use their ships to attack the UN-controlled high seas.International piracy is a global problem. There are a myriad of challenges to international peace and security, and piracy is a large part of those. However, piracy is a global crime that requires a global response, and a global solution.The international law of the sea is weak. Its mandate does not include the piracy of the high seas. The UNOLS is tasked with monitoring the high seas, but it has no authority over piracy.",ai_generated

"A recent report released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reveals an alarming increase in drug trafficking across the African continent, resulting in a significant negative impact on public health and national security.The study, conducted over several years, indicates that Africa is now a major transit hub for global drug trafficking, with cartels exploiting the continent's porous borders and weak governance to smuggle narcotics from South America and Asia to Europe and North America. The report further emphasizes that the proliferation of drug use and drug-related crime is increasingly destabilizing many African countries and poses significant challenges to regional peace and stability.Among the most commonly trafficked drugs in Africa are cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine, with recent trends showing a surge in synthetic opioids and prescription drug abuse. According to the UNODC, drug cartels are particularly attracted to Africa due to its strategic location between major drug-producing regions in South America and Asia and high-demand markets in Europe and North America.A critical aspect of this crisis is the involvement of organized crime and terrorist groups in drug trafficking. The report reveals a strong link between these criminal networks and extremist groups operating in the Sahel region and North Africa, such as Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). These groups often use drug trafficking as a means to fund their terrorist activities, further exacerbating the issue and making it a matter of both national and international security.Additionally, the UNODC report highlights the growing issue of drug addiction and its detrimental effects on public health in Africa. With the rising use of drugs, African countries are grappling with an increase in drug-related violence, HIV/AIDS infection rates, and a lack of adequate treatment and rehabilitation facilities.In response to these findings, the UNODC calls for a multi-faceted approach to combat the surge in drug trafficking in Africa, including increased cooperation between governments and regional organizations, such as the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).",ai_generated

The government's residential construction report can be volatile on a monthly basis, which might explain the slight decrease.Home construction has improved much of this year, with single-family houses accounting for much of the gains unlike recent years when developers focused more on apartments. Housing starts have climbed 10.2 percent compared to the first five months of 2015, a sign that healthy demand exists because of ultra-low mortgage rates and a relatively healthy job market with unemployment at 4.7 percent.Single-family house starts have climbed 14.5 percent this year, evidence that builders are actively seeking homeowners rather than renters.``Single family builders are slowly, but surely, gaining ground on what has been a strong four years for multifamily construction,'' said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at the online real estate firm Trulia.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect that single-family construction will total 800,000 this year. That would mark solid growth, yet remain significantly below the 1960 to 2000 average of 1.04 million in a sign of how sluggish the recovery from the housing bust and recession has been.Starts rose 14.4 percent in the West and 1.5 percent in the South last month.",human

"Many people do not exercise enough, even though they know they should. One incentive might just come from the doctor. Recent studies show that a written prescription for exercise helps motivate people to get moving. People around the world spend billions of dollars each year on medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure and control weight and diabetes.Doctors -- and most of their patients -- know that exercise is one of the best things people can do for themselves. Exercise lowers cholesterol, helps control diabetes, contributes to weight loss, and lowers blood pressure. Just as importantly, it reduces the need for medications to control many of these conditions. Professor Miriam Morey led the most recent study on prescribing exercise. She focused on cancer survivors like Joe Collie, who had surgery for prostate cancer. ""The operation was in July of '93, so it's been 16 years since I had that procedure,"" he explains.Collie and more than 600 other cancer survivors went on diets and exercise programs tailored to their needs.

"Scientists have been warning us about the consequences of climate change for years, but it seems that those consequences are coming sooner than predicted and with greater intensity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report that paints a bleak picture of our planet's future if we don't take immediate action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.According to the report, we can expect more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires as the planet continues to warm. These weather events will have devastating effects on communities around the world, particularly in areas that are already struggling with poverty and lack of resources.The report also warns of the impact on food production, as changing weather patterns and extreme weather events disrupt crop yields and make it more difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed the world's growing population.In addition to these environmental and humanitarian impacts, climate change will also have serious economic consequences. The report notes that we can expect increased damage to infrastructure, higher insurance costs, and reduced economic productivity as a result of extreme weather events.It's clear that urgent action is needed to address the threat of climate change. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We need to invest in renewable energy, promote energy efficiency, and change our consumption patterns to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.The impacts of climate change are coming sooner and faster than we thought, but it's not too late to take action. We owe it to future generations to do everything we can to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for all.",ai_generated
"Inclusion Into World Trade Organisation (WTO)Citing the current economic crisis, the WTO General Council asked the Indian Government to withdraw the exemption the country has given DRC for the inclusion of minerals in India as per WTO rules. The Indian Government had been issuing exemption from customs duty in order to allow more supply of DRC minerals, however, when the crisis hit, the government allowed DRC government to give concessions to industries which were not allowed to purchase minerals from DRC.The WTO agreed that the DRC mineral's are likely to be included for Indian market due to the global crisis. The government's stance on the matter is reportedly the same as DRC government's and this has created issues for industries.Source: BusinesswireIndian Govt gives mining concessions to DRC in bid to boost economic activityThe Indian Govt has reportedly given mining concessions to DRC in return for the help it will bring India's economy. India had been granting mineral concessions in order to attract India's investment in the mineral sector as well as support Indian industries who are suffering from shortage of DRC minerals due to the global price spike in the metal.According to the new report, India's government has provided relief from the customs duty for the DRC minerals in order to facilitate India's investment in the mineral sector. This is in return for the help India can bring in the DRC through mining and other forms of investment. It is not known how much the DRC can earn due to India's mineral concessions and how the Indian government will use the profits from the DRC minerals.What this means for India's industries is a loss of money which is expected to rise in the coming years. India's mines may be struggling in terms of investment due to the scarcity of DRC minerals because the prices have spiked for DRC commodities over the years and the demand is increasing which has also caused a hike in the prices.",ai_generated

"CAPITOL HILL - The U.S. Senate has advanced a bill to restart federal jobless benefits that expired late last year for the long-term unemployed. Final approval is expected by week’s end in the Democrat-controlled chamber, but the bill may not get a vote in the Republican-led House of Representatives. Normally, unemployed Americans are entitled to six months of modest, government-provided income to help them and their families cover basic needs until a job is secured. But economic conditions are far from normal, according to Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who said millions of Americans need more time to find work and extended unemployment benefits in the meantime. “They are hoping to make their payment on their light bill. They are hoping to make their rent payment or their mortgages payment. And savings run thin. And that is why, during periods of high unemployment, we have created a longer unemployment insurance bridge to get them to that next job,” Merkley said. Jobless benefits have been extended repeatedly since the 2008 financial crisis. But Congress allowed the extension to expire in December, causing millions to lose compensation. Many would get retroactive benefits if the Senate bill became law.

"After years of debate over whether California's drought was caused by humans or just a natural occurrence, a new study has confirmed that the drought was, in fact, a natural phenomenon.The study, published in the journal Nature, analyzed the historic drought patterns in California and found that the state has experienced similar droughts in the past that were not caused by human activity.""Over the last millennium, California has had quite a few droughts that are of a similar magnitude to the drought we just experienced,"" said lead author of the study, Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.However, the study did not completely rule out the role of human activity in exacerbating the drought. Climate change, caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, may have played a role in making the drought worse, the authors said.California's recent drought, which began in 2011 and officially ended in 2019, was one of the worst in the state's history. It led to widespread water shortages, dried up reservoirs, and devastated crops.The study's findings may have implications for water management policies in California, which have focused heavily on reducing human water usage in response to the drought.""It's not to say that we shouldn't be thinking about conservation and management of water resources,"" Williams said. ""We should be doing that regardless of whether the drought is caused by humans or not.""The study underscores the need for continued research into the complex relationship between climate change and natural phenomena like drought, as well as the importance of using science to guide policy decisions.",ai_generated

"D.C. Is for WritersLearning to SweepThe Great American LonelinessCan a Slow Journalism Movement Help the News Business Survive?Annals of ObamaWhat's the Matter with Liberalism?Bulletin from an Orwellian FutureTrump's VindicationRevenge of the BlobWilliam A. Cohen at 1:32 PMRev. Arthur Pearson November 14, 2017 at 9:55 AMThe author, I'm sure, is correct that there has been ""a surge in white supremacist activity in the United States."" I'm not so sure about his assumption that this surge is ""encouraged by Trump's rhetoric."" If one were to ask the man in the street (to use an old metaphor) he would probably say that Trump's election was inspired by a surge in white supremacist activity. It doesn't take very much research to discover that this is an illusion. It is a fact that those who voted for Trump were for the most part NOT white supremacists and they were not moved to vote for Trump because he appealed to the interests of white supremacists. Trump's election can be laid to the door of those who are unable to articulate a message other than ""white supremacy."" The election was won by those who believed in something other than white supremacy. The Democrats and their friends in the main-stream media, and in the Republican party, have chosen, as it seems, to continue on their previous path. They may succeed; at the moment it appears that they are succeeding, but the result will not be a victory for white supremacy. The result will be the end of white supremacy in this country. In the meantime, the Democrats will probably win a few local and legislative elections, but Trump will most probably be reelected in 2020.",ai_generated
"Liberia's transitional government has agreed to allow international organizations to oversee the country's future financial deals as part of the government's anti-corruption campaign. The move allays concern in Liberia that the international community will disengage from Liberia after elections.Liberian Information Minister William Allen said Wednesday that the transitional government had signed an anti-corruption document as part of a financial assistance plan for the country.The plan known as GEMAP will also give international officials the power to supervise how the government's revenue is collected and how major projects are financed.The interim government, led by Chairman Gyude Bryant, has been accused of rampant corruption and Mr. Bryant reportedly refused to sign the financial assistance plan at first. He has denied any wrongdoing and says his government has been working for the welfare of the people.The new plan ties international assistance to good government management. Mr. Allen said that the anti-corruption text will be renegotiated after 36 months, but will affect the new government which will be elected on October 11.A representative from the World Bank's West Africa office, Mats Karlsson, said that the plan is innovative and allows international supervision of government contracts in areas such as customs and maritime resources.""",human

": A Medical Breakthrough for Sports and Trauma VictimsIn a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have successfully developed a blood test capable of detecting concussions, offering a promising new method for diagnosing traumatic brain injuries in sports players and accident victims. The innovative test, which has been extensively studied and tested, could lead to faster diagnosis, improved treatment, and reduced long-term health risks associated with brain trauma.Concussions, which are a form of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), are caused by a sudden blow or jolt to the head, leading to temporary disruptions in brain function. These injuries are common in contact sports such as football, hockey, and rugby, as well as in car accidents and falls. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and memory problems, which often resolve within days or weeks. However, repeated concussions can lead to long-term cognitive and neurological issues, making early diagnosis and intervention crucial.Current methods of diagnosing concussions primarily involve a series of cognitive and physical tests, such as checking a patient's reflexes, balance, and memory. While these tests can be useful, they are subjective and can fail to detect more subtle brain injuries.",ai_generated

According to Amnesty International, the group has killed more than 30,000 people and displaced over two million in the Lake Chad Basin region.The ICC first opened a preliminary examination into Boko Haram's activities in 2010, but Amnesty has expressed concerns that progress has been slow. In its statement, the organization said that the ICC's preliminary examination has been ongoing for over a decade and that it is high time the court moved to the next stage of its investigation.Amnesty International's Senior Crisis Advisor, Joanne Mariner, said that ""a decade of violence and human suffering in the conflict with Boko Haram has been ignored by the ICC."" She added that it is now ""time for the ICC to stop dragging its feet and to fully investigate the shocking crimes committed by all sides.""Mariner also said that the Nigerian government has not demonstrated the ability or willingness to hold those responsible for the crimes accountable. This failure to act has only served to strengthen the call for the ICC to take a more proactive role in delivering justice to the affected communities.The Amnesty statement comes at a time when Nigeria is experiencing a resurgence in Boko Haram attacks. In June this year, the group carried out several attacks in the northeastern region, killing dozens of people, including security forces and aid workers.In response to Amnesty's call, the ICC said that it would continue to analyze information from various sources in Nigeria and that it is committed to its mission of holding perpetrators accountable.

Over the last several days, he has ordered military troops to fan out across the country and announced plans to vastly expand the country’s civilian militia – to half a million members from its current 100,000.The U.S. State Department on Tuesday issued a statement warning that the “international community” would join in any response to the “criminal repression of peaceful democratic activity...”The statement, put out by spokesman Mark C. Toner, urged nonviolent demonstrations. “We deplore the use of violence against unarmed protestors,” it said. Using the abbreviation for the ruling United Socialist Party, it particularly warned against using “colectivos – armed bands under the political control of PSUV party leaders – to repress protestors while the security forces … idly stand by.” Security forces and members of the judiciary, the statement continued, have “legal and constitutional responsibilities to protect, not prevent, peaceful demonstrations.”Maduro rejected the statement, saying the State Department in essence had announced a coup against Venezuela.“Whoever wants to see the script written to generate violence, death … read the statement. There is the plan,” he said.Supporters of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro take to the streets of Caracas to counter an opposition march, April 19, 2017. (A.",human

"DAR ES SALAM, TANZANIA - Tanzania’s government says is teaming up with Mozambique to launch a joint operation against violent attacks by Islamist militants along their shared border. But some opposition parties and rights groups are raising concerns about how the Tanzanian government plans to tackle the threat.Several recent attacks blamed on Islamist extremists have targeted the border village of Ktaya in Tanzania’s Mtwara region.Police say more than 175 houses were set on fire and some people were killed by assailants, who, authorities say, fled into neighboring Mozambique.Tanzania has already increased security along the border and it is now joining forces with Mozambique to contain what it calls terrorists.Simon Sirro, Tanzania’s police commander, says there will be a joint operation because the attackers come from Mozambique and they have much information to make sure that we catch those terrorists. Sirro adds that the big thing that we ask Tanzanians especially for is those who live in the neighboring villages to make sure they give us information.

"NEW DELHI - They occupy only 25 per cent of the work force, less than 12 per cent of parliamentary seats, a backseat in many homes dominated by patriarchal voices, but in one significant area Indian women have emerged on par with men: at polling booths. That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",human

"As Somalia faces yet another severe drought, thousands of people are being forced to leave their homes and communities in search of water and food. The country's continuing struggle with drought is a humanitarian crisis in a nation already burdened by political instability and the fight against terrorism.The United Nations has warned that 2.7 million people, or roughly one-quarter of the Somali population, are currently in need of urgent life-saving assistance. Many have lost their livestock and have resorted to eating wild fruit and drinking unclean water to survive.The dry weather has affected almost all regions of the country, but the worst-hit areas are the central and northern regions, including the Puntland and Somaliland regions, which have experienced an extended period of low rainfall. This drought comes only five years after the devastating 2016-2017 drought, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and left millions more in need of aid.The dire situation is further complicated by the political turmoil in the country. The long-delayed national elections, initially planned for 2020, have yet to take place. Meanwhile, the power struggle between the federal government and regional governments continues to intensify. This political instability has impeded efforts to deliver aid to the affected population.Moreover, the drought has had a significant impact on the economy, as agriculture and livestock contribute nearly 75% of Somalia's GDP. With the majority of livestock decimated and crops failing to grow, the livelihoods of thousands have been destroyed.International agencies and governments, including the United Nations and European Union, have expressed their concern about the crisis. They have appealed for immediate aid, with a focus on providing water, food, and medical assistance to the affected communities. However, the response from the international community has been slow, with aid agencies struggling to secure funding to support the affected population.One major concern is that the ongoing drought may lead to an increase in the recruitment of child soldiers and the radicalization of vulnerable youth. With desperation driving young people to join armed groups, such as the extremist group Al-Shabaab, in exchange for food, the humanitarian crisis may become a security issue as well.Efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable agriculture and water management practices are essential to addressing the root causes of the recurring droughts in Somalia.",ai_generated

"In a significant move towards regional cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders have called for the removal of sanctions against Burma, also known as Myanmar. The call comes in light of the ongoing progress made by the Burmese government to engage in democratic reforms, and as a means to bolster economic development in the region.This appeal was made during the annual ASEAN summit held in Jakarta, Indonesia, where leaders from 10 Southeast Asian nations gathered to discuss pressing regional and global issues. The call to end the sanctions is aimed at further integrating Burma into the regional economy and allowing its populace to benefit from increased trade and investment.Since 2011, Burma has been on the path of political and economic reforms, after decades of military rule. The country's political landscape has transformed significantly, with the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, winning a landslide victory in the 2015 general elections. These reforms have led to the lifting of various sanctions by the international community over the years, including those imposed by the European Union and the United States.The current sanctions on Burma are mainly imposed by the United Nations due to ongoing concerns over human rights abuses, particularly concerning the Rohingya Muslim minority. The Burmese government has been criticized for not doing enough to address the crisis and bring about a lasting solution.During the summit, ASEAN leaders acknowledged the efforts made by the Burmese government to address these human rights concerns and work towards national reconciliation. They also noted the importance of continued dialogue and cooperation between the Burmese government and relevant stakeholders to resolve these issues and pave the way for lasting peace and stability in the country.The call for the removal of sanctions against Burma is seen as a move to strengthen regional ties within the ASEAN community and to foster closer economic integration among member states. With a combined GDP of over $3 trillion, ASEAN is the third-largest economy in Asia and the sixth largest in the world. The removal of sanctions would further facilitate the growth of the regional economy and enhance cooperation among its member countries.It remains to be seen how the international community, particularly the United Nations, will respond to ASEAN's call for dropping sanctions on Burma. Nevertheless, this development serves as a clear sign of the region's commitment to working together in the pursuit of peace, stability, and economic prosperity.",ai_generated
"Seventy-five years after the disappearance of famed woman aviator Amelia Earhart, explorers are getting closer to solving the mystery of what happened to her. She disappeared over the Pacific while attempting to circumnavigate the globe in her airplane. TIGHAR, The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, has launched nine expeditions in the past 24 years looking for clues. Earhart was a pioneering American aviator in the early 20th century. The first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, she became a national celebrity. In July of 1937, she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific while attempting to fly around the world. To this day their fate is shrouded in mystery. Seventy-five years later, The International Group For Historic Aircraft Recovery, TIGHAR, works to solve the mystery. “The romantic attraction of the Earhart mystery, she was the celebrity that inspired people when she was alive. And then she disappeared in such a mysterious way,” said Rick Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR. Earhart disappeared while flying from Lae, Papua New Guinea, to Howland Island, 3,100 kilometers southwest of Hawaii. TIGHAR researchers believe she ran low on fuel and veered off course to the small uninhabited island of Nikumaroro, which was never thoroughly searched during the initial 1937 investigation. “We said, 'Wow, nobody ever looked for Amelia Earhart in the most likely place?'

The new round of tariffs is proposed on a list of goods the US imports from China, including computers and electronic products, food, footwear, toys, games, and sports equipment.The latest increase is a continuation of a 12-month trade conflict between the two countries that has seen both the United States and China level increasingly heavy tariffs on each other’s goods. This newest round of tariffs was originally set to be implemented in the latter half of the 2019, but has been brought forward following the breakdown of trade talks between the two countries in May.The proposed 25% tariff would be levied on imports valued at around $200 billion. If the new round of tariffs does come to fruition, almost all Chinese products imported into the United States will be subject to tariffs.A number of products are exempt from tariffs, including mobile phones, laptops, and video game consoles. Tariffs are set to be levied on a range of products including dishwashers and ovens, but not refrigerators and washing machines. China exports more dishwashers and ovens to the US than the latter two products, but the United States imports far more washing machines and refrigerators from China than dishwashers and ovens.The exclusion of some products and the inclusion of others shows that the US tariffs are targeted at specific industries and companies. While they are not directed at China alone, the tariffs are directed at Chinese companies, rather than American companies that operate in China.China has retaliated to US tariffs by increasing import taxes on a range of US goods. China is also planning to place restrictions on rare-earth exports, but is yet to formally announce them. Rare-earth metals are used in the production of electronics, from mobile phones to aircraft and military equipment.",ai_generated

"In a surprising turn of events, Chinese authorities have decided to commute the prison sentence of a prominent dissident, reducing the time he will spend behind bars. The individual, whose name has been withheld for his safety, is a vocal advocate for democratic reforms, transparency, and the rule of law in China. The unexpected decision has been welcomed by human rights activists and is seen as a step towards a more lenient approach to political dissent.The dissident, a former professor and political commentator, was initially sentenced to over a decade in prison for inciting subversion of state power. His writings and online presence garnered a significant following, sparking heated discussions on topics such as political reform, the influence of the Communist Party, and corruption within the country's government. Despite international condemnation, the Chinese government has maintained a strong stance against political dissent, often subjecting its critics to lengthy prison sentences and harsh punishments. Human rights organizations have continuously raised concerns regarding China's suppression of political dissent and the overall lack of freedom of expression within the country.The decision to commute the dissident's prison sentence is an unexpected change of course, with no official explanation provided by the Chinese authorities.",ai_generated
"President Donald Trump will allow year-round sales of renewable fuel with blends of 15 percent ethanol as part of an emerging deal to make changes to the federal ethanol mandate. Republican senators and the White House announced the deal Tuesday after a closed-door meeting, the latest in a series of White House sessions on ethanol. The Environmental Protection Agency currently bans the 15-percent blend, called E15, during the summer because of concerns that it contributes to smog on hot days. Gasoline typically contains 10 percent ethanol. Farm-state lawmakers have pushed for greater sales of the higher ethanol blend to boost demand for the corn-based fuel. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley called the agreement good news for farmers and drivers alike, saying it would increase ethanol production and consumer choice at the pump. Texas Sen.

"Otis Redding was an African-American singer, whose name is synonymous with soul music. The style ? a combination of gospel music and rhythm and blues ? rose out of the Southern black experience in America and became popular in the 1960s. Although Redding had a short career ? he died at age 26 ? his music is still popular 40 years after his death. In his hometown of Macon, Georgia, a new exhibit celebrates his life and music. Philip Graitcer reports.Otis Redding grew up in Macon, Georgia, and began performing in his father's church choir when he was 7. By the time he was 15, he was a local star, and by 1963, the 22-year-old soul singer was a national celebrity.And for anyone ? black or white ? growing up in America in the 1960s, Otis Redding's music told the truth about love, happiness and heartbreak.To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Redding's death in 1967, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame ? a museum about the state's musicians ? planned a modest exhibit of photographs.But when Redding's widow, Zelma, lent a couple of boxes of memorabilia to the museum, curator Ellen Fleurov quickly realized that she had the makings of something more than a photo show. ""There were documents and artifacts and material that had not been seen, ever. It was a 'Eureka moment' for me as a curator,"" she recalls.So she expanded the exhibit to become a definitive look at the life and career of Otis Redding.There are more than 175 artifacts: pictures, oral histories, recordings, performance footage and scrapbooks.

The article went on to claim that these negotiations were being conducted without the knowledge of the Libyan people or the international community.The Libyan government has vehemently denied these allegations, stating that they have consistently maintained a policy of zero tolerance towards extremist groups.

New Horizons scientists are presenting the first in a series of papers on the mission's findings on October 15 in Maryland.New Horizons spacecraft reveals new close-ups of Pluto’s atmosphereThe atmosphere of Pluto, an ice dwarf planet whose largest moon is Charon, is blue.The atmospheric haze or skyglow of Pluto is thought to be similar to that of Earth, but the composition is entirely different. Atmospheric models suggest that it is somewhat like that of Titan.Although Pluto is much colder than Titan at the surface, Pluto's atmosphere extends 200 kilometers or more above its surface. The lower temperature means its upper atmosphere should be slightly denser than Titan's. In the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere, Pluto's atmosphere contains a large amount of ethylene, acetylene, and ethane which are formed by the breakdown of methane by solar ultraviolet radiation.Pluto's lower atmosphere also contains simple hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, which are in vapor form. The source of these hydrocarbons is believed to be Pluto itself, a source of methane clathrate. These clathrates would have been heated by the atmosphere, releasing gaseous methane that was carried aloft.Pluto's atmosphere consists of more than 90% nitrogen, with the remaining 10% methane and carbon monoxide.",ai_generated

Russia would need to buy about 20 percent more U.S. natural gas to avoid a new tariff, which would amount to roughly $300 million a year.That would allow Russia to turn a profit in some cases even if it is giving away the gas at a loss.""A deal could still be reached.

"Western news agencies say the Iranian rial has weakened significantly against the dollar in black market trading following the U.S. decision to exit the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Published reports say the rial has been quoted as low as 80,000 to 90,000 against the dollar on the black market since the U.S. exit from the deal was announced Tuesday. Reuters says the black market rate was around 65,000 rials to the dollar just before that announcement.Iran fixed its exchange rate at 42,000 to the dollar last month, combining its official and ""free-market"" exchange rates into one rate and criminalizing trade at any other levels.But Iranian public demand for dollars has remained higher than the levels supplied through official currency exchanges, prompting ""free-market"" trade to continue as black market transactions, some of them online. The rise in the black market cost of dollars makes it more expensive for Iranians to travel abroad and buy dollar-denominated goods and services.Iranian American economist Siamak Shojai, based at William Paterson University in New Jersey, told VOA Persian’s NewsHour program on Thursday that the rial’s slump is largely a result of Iranian government mismanagement of the economy and Iranian involvement in regional conflicts.",human

"KUALA LUMPUR - Voters have a stark choice in Malaysia's election on Wednesday: resurrect the country's 92-year-old former authoritarian leader or give a third term to Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose alleged role in the multibillion-dollar ransacking of a state investment fund has battered Malaysia's standing abroad. Najib's ruling party, in control for six decades, is likely to hold on to power due to an electoral system that gives more weight to rural voters, analysts say, but at the price of reduced legitimacy. The contest pits Najib, a political blue blood, against his former political mentor, Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister for 22 years until 2003 and credited with modernizing Malaysia. Angered by the corruption scandal that engulfed the state investment fund set up and overseen by Najib, Mahathir defected from the ruling coalition's dominant United Malays National Organization party and joined forces with opposition parties who had regarded him as their chief nemesis. U.S. investigators say $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, the investment fund, by associates of Najib between 2009 and 2014, including $700 million that landed in Najib's bank account.

"Title: In a groundbreaking medical development, doctors may soon be able to predict a patient's chances of surviving lung cancer, thus offering new hope to millions affected by the deadly disease. This advancement comes as a result of an innovative study that brings together advanced technology and clinical expertise, which aims to revolutionize the way lung cancer patients are diagnosed and treated.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases each year. The five-year survival rate is dismally low, at only around 18%. One of the significant factors contributing to this high mortality rate is that the disease is often detected at a late stage, when treatment options are limited and less effective.The study, conducted by a team of researchers from various institutions, has developed an advanced diagnostic tool that analyzes a patient's genetic information to predict their chances of survival. The tool examines the genomic makeup of lung cancer tumors, looking for specific genetic mutations and other molecular markers that are associated with the development and progression of the disease. This new approach could allow doctors to tailor treatments to individual patients, based on their tumor's unique genetic characteristics.Furthermore, the study explored the potential of using a patient's immune response data as another way of predicting survival outcomes. Researchers found that certain immune system proteins, known as cytokines, could act as potential biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis.",ai_generated

"The capital of Jordan is bracing for what the Muslim Brotherhood says will be a massive demonstration Friday demanding far-reaching government reforms from King Abdullah II. The Muslim Brotherhood, Jordan’s largest opposition group, is calling its rally a “Save the Homeland” march and predicts it will attract more than 50,000 people in central Amman. The group is demanding reforms that would create a less centralized governing structure and ensure more opposition seats in parliament. Organizers of a rival march by the Youth Coalition of Loyalty and Allegiance canceled their planned Friday rally, saying they wanted to avoid a confrontation and possible violence on Friday. The planned march comes as King Abdullah dissolved parliament on Thursday, opening the way for early elections, probably late this year. The Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Islamic Action Front, have vowed to boycott any parliamentary elections, saying the king needs to push through government reforms first. “We are calling for real reforms that restore power to Jordanian people and curb the powers of those who have seized power and influence for decades,” Zaki Bani Rusheid, a Brotherhood leader, told the Reuters news agency.

That is a 50 percent increase over the number of people the agency has been assisting since Russian-backed rebels in Eastern Ukraine began fighting for a separate state four years ago.Millions of people continue to suffer from acute humanitarian needs brought on by Ukraine’s conflict. U.N. Migration spokesman Joel Millman said it is important to remember the heavy toll the low-intensity conflict is taking on the lives of people in the impoverished country.“Since April 2014, over 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine and a further 24,000 have been injured. In total, 3.4 million people require humanitarian assistance.

He explained to VOA why the opposition in South Africa is not pleased with President Mbeki?s mediation role.?The reason is that they are putting conditions for the opposition that they must cease being violent; they must accept that it is a legitimate government. This is very wrong. When you mediate, you don?t take sides. You try to equalize the situation. You ask all parties that they must not be violent against each other. But in this case when you tell the victims that they must not be violent, and at the same time they must change their opinion in terms of whether they regard the unfair election that were not free as fraudulent, it is being unfair,? he said.Seremane said the South African opposition perceives President Mbeki?s mediation strategy as favoring President Mugabe of Zimbabwe.?We are not passing judgment.

"The United States Supreme Court has declined to hear the case of a florist in Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The case involves Barronelle Stutzman, who was sued by the state of Washington and the American Civil Liberties Union after she refused to create floral arrangements for a gay couple's wedding in 2013. Stutzman argued that her religious beliefs prohibited her from providing services for the wedding, and her lawyers have argued that the case violates her First Amendment rights. However, the Washington Supreme Court ruled against Stutzman, finding that she had violated the state's anti-discrimination laws. Stutzman appealed the decision to the US Supreme Court, but the court declined to take up the case, leaving the Washington Supreme Court's ruling in place. The decision comes as a disappointment to religious freedom advocates, who had hoped that the court would take a stand on the issue. The decision also highlights the ongoing legal battle between LGBT rights and religious freedom in the US. While some argue that businesses should be able to refuse service based on their religious beliefs, others believe that such refusals constitute discrimination and violate civil rights laws. The decision by the US Supreme Court leaves in place the Washington Supreme Court's ruling that Stutzman had violated the state's anti-discrimination laws.

The US stance was reiterated during a visit by the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Matthew Palmer, who met with top Bosnian officials in Sarajevo on Monday.During his visit, Palmer emphasized the strategic importance of Bosnia and Herzegovina's NATO membership, saying it would enhance regional stability and contribute to collective security in the Balkans. He also addressed the concerns of Bosnian Serbs, who have strongly opposed the move, stating that ""the US respects the views of all citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but we believe that NATO membership will bring benefits to all communities.""Bosnia and Herzegovina has been pursuing NATO membership since 2010 and is already a member of the alliance's Partnership for Peace program. The country has participated in NATO-led missions in Afghanistan and has contributed to the alliance's efforts in the fight against terrorism.

Dodik has argued that joining NATO would not be in the best interest of the Bosnian Serb community and has instead advocated for closer ties with Russia.Despite the ongoing opposition, the US has remained steadfast in its support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's NATO aspirations.

"Forty years ago this summer, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair drew hundreds of thousands of people to upstate New York, for the musical event of a lifetime. Held from August 15th to the 18th, 1969, the festival was intended as ""three days of peace and music"", and was attended by people from all walks of life.More than 30 musicians performed during the event, including notable acts like Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead, and Janis Joplin. While the sound and look of Woodstock was of the decade, its legacy has proven timeless. A lasting symbol of the counterculture, Woodstock has come to represent youthful revolt and peaceful protest against war and injustice.Of course, that was not the intention of the original planners. As Michael Lang, one of the original four producers of Woodstock, told the Associated Press, ""It was never intended to be a political event. We just wanted to bring music and art together and create an atmosphere where people could get off on what they heard and what they saw.""The atmosphere, however, was indeed groovy. Despite multiple obstacles -like the abandonment of the original location of Wallkill and last minute site change to Bethel- the event was considered a success, and there were no major incidents of violence or theft. The 1969 event was also the first of its kind, and would pave the way for many more music festivals in the coming years.Today, the spirit of Woodstock lives on in modern times. The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, located on the site of the original event, hosted a three-day celebration from August 15th to 18th to commemorate the 40th anniversary. The celebration included a lecture by Lang, a gala dinner, and performances by Crosby, Stills & Nash and Levon Helm, among many others.The spirit of peace and togetherness lives on, though certainly the look of Woodstock has changed in the last 40 years. As Lang noted, ""It was 1969. People wanted to express themselves. Today it's a different era and technology has changed the way we express ourselves.""

"VOA News, By Gilbert da Costa, WashingtonThe latest attempt to restructure Nigeria's troubled state power industry has brought new controversy to efforts to improve electricity production in Africa's most populous nation.The proposal for a major reform of the troubled electricity industry in Nigeria is being attacked by organized labor as a ploy to make electricity supply more expensive.""Electricity is supposed to be a service and not a business,"" says Oyekunle Edun of the United Labour Congress, Nigeria. ""If you put a price on it and you want to privatize and you want to profit on it, it means you will not be looking at the masses.""President Umaru Yar'Adua announced the restructuring of Nigeria's Power Holding Company of Nigeria, known as PHCN, earlier this month.The announcement has prompted the labor unions to call for protests on Thursday. Unions allege that they and other critical stakeholders in the electricity sector were never consulted about the reforms.But the plan would turn state-run PHCN into a holding company that would generate and transmit power, while distribution will be done by the private sector.The Electricity Regulatory Commission of Nigeria, which regulates the industry, has given its backing to the proposed reform. Chairman Sam Amadi says that the commission has been calling for a review of the electricity sector for the past three years.""We need this to happen, so that we can begin to unlock the huge investment opportunities that we have in the sector,"" he says.The Nigerian private sector has welcomed the new reform initiative but is cautiously optimistic. Tony Elumelu, chairman of the Nigerian private sector organization, says there is a history of broken promises in privatization.""That is a bit of what worries us about government initiatives, they are never carried to a logical conclusion,"" says Elumelu.

"About two-thirds of Americans say drug abusers need access to treatment to address their addiction rather than criminal prosecution that could lead to jail time, according to a poll released on Wednesday that highlights the public's shifting attitude toward illegal drugs in the United States. While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. ""The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,"" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse.

In defiance of a court order, the teachers say they will not return to the classroom until the government fully meets their demands. Even though the government calls the strike illegal, it says it is ready to negotiate with the teachers.Kilemi Mwiria is Kenya?s deputy minister of education. He talked with VOA English to Africa reporter Peter Clottey about the strike.?The lecturers decided to go on strike last Monday, because the salary package they are asking for was not possible to be given by government. There is a committee of university counsels that have been negotiating with them and made an offer to them, which would amount to more than a third of what they are asking for but which is still a significant improvement from what they were making. The university lecturers said they were not going to take it and there has not been any possibility of dialogue, which is unfortunate. So basically, we are saying that we hope that we will give dialogue a chance and that the 600% the lecturers are asking for is not tenable, it?s unreasonable, it?s not sustainable.

"WARSAW, POLAND - Polish President Andrzej Duda has pardoned a minister in the country's new conservative government who was convicted of abuse of power as head of the anti-corruption body in 2007.Duda pardoned Mariusz Kaminski, the coordinator of special services in the new government of Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, responsible for overseeing police and intelligence agencies.The pardon was announced late Tuesday. It highlights the strong cooperation between Law and Justice, the country's ruling right-wing party, and Duda, who won the presidency on the party's ticket. It drew strong criticism from law experts and politicians, who called it a premature step and a “dangerous precedent.”Duda argued on Wednesday that it was his intention to free the independent courts from having to rule in this politically charged case.Kaminski was the head of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau when Law and Justice previously ran the government, from 2005-2007. Earlier this year he was sentenced to three years in prison. The court found him guilty of entrapment targeting the Agriculture Ministry, eavesdropping and fabricating documents in 2007, as head of the anti-corruption body.",human

The results showed that a majority of students are feeling pessimistic about the future.When asked about their confidence in America's future, only 22% of students said they were ""very confident"". This is a significant decrease from just a few years ago, when the same survey found that 36% of students felt very confident about the future.The survey also showed that students are increasingly concerned about issues such as economic inequality, social justice, and climate change. Many students feel that these problems are not being adequately addressed by political leaders and institutions.Overall, the survey suggests that young people in America are feeling disillusioned and unsure about what lies ahead.

"WASHINGTON - Vladimir Putin appears well on his way to reclaiming the Crimea for Russia, restoring the peninsula to a status forfeited by Nikita Khrushchev’s Soviet Union in 1954.But this territorial achievement may provide only temporary distraction for Russia’s 140 million people who have seen their quality of life deteriorate dramatically since Putin took power in 1999.“Russians, The People Behind the Power,” former NPR Moscow correspondent Gregory Feifer depicts a society with a thin crony capitalist veneer that is increasingly afflicted by corruption, alcoholism and other social ills. While none of these are new for Russia, what is surprising is that they have gotten so much worse under Putin.Although Putin is far more disciplined than the man who anointed him -- Boris Yeltsin, a heavy drinker who came to personify Russia’s loss of status following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- the system Putin has put in place is, Feifer writes, “far more corrupt and inequitable … than anything seen under Yeltsin.”While Moscow dazzles with new restaurants, boutiques and nightclubs patronized by a privileged elite, the countryside crumbles and the business environment is increasingly distorted by corruption. According to Feifer, the bribes ordinary businessmen must pay simply to operate have increased more than six-fold from an average $23,000 a year when Putin took office to $135,000.",human
"The German police are using an incoming technique to find bodies in remote areas: detective urubus. These birds were trained by the police to fly over hard-to-reach areas in search of bodies and dead bodies. Orcas are able to locate carcasses up to three kilometers away, which makes this technique very efficient. According to the authorities, this technique has been useful in investigating cases of missing people in forest and mountainous areas. Now, it's possible for ants to get to places that are inaccessible to humans, which makes them a valuable tool for researchers. However, this technique is not new.

"In recent tests, North Korea has been improving the firepower of its missiles that can target South Korea, making them ready to deploy on a battlefield, experts said.“North Korea has been enhancing its firepower, war-fighting capabilities over the past two years, flight-testing a number of new systems,” including the KN-25 missile and variants such as the KN-23 and KN-24, said Michael Elleman, director of the Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Both systems ""are capable of threatening targets in South Korea and are likely more accurate and lethal than the systems previously seen in North Korea,” he said.Compared with artillery positioned across the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone, Elleman said, the KN-25 missiles give Pyongyang the ability “to attack the South relentlessly in the opening hours or days of conflict.”North Korea’s launches on March 2 and March 9 included KN-25 missiles that the regime began testing on August 24. The March 9 launch was Pyongyang’s sixth KN-25 test.North Korea tested similar missiles on July 31 and August 2, but they were smaller than the KN-25, Elleman said.The KN-25 is a long-range artillery rocket with a guidance system to control its flight path. Because it has a guidance system like a ballistic missile, the U.S. classifies the KN-25 as a missile.According to Elleman, the U.S. calls it “a close-range ballistic missile,” a type of short-range ballistic missile. North Korea described both launches earlier this month as “long-range artillery” drills.“",human

"NEW DELHI - The U.S. Ambassador to India has met Indian opposition leader Narendra Modi, ending a near decade-long boycott of the man who is the frontrunner to be India’s next prime minister. The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",human
"TAIPEI - An increase in world oil prices is helping Vietnam earn money that will quicken its already fast economic growth and may help the country build new infrastructure. The only red light: higher fuel prices among Vietnam's consumers.Vietnam, though not a major oil-producing nation like much of the Middle East, has counted energy-related commodities as its fifth highest source of exports. The industry is largely state-owned, including energy supplier PetroVietnam, with $3.1 billion in annual sales. Much of Vietnam’s energy comes from under the seas off its east and south coasts.If crude oil prices hold at an average $65 per barrel this year, above last year’s average of US$60, economic growth will exceed the 6.7 percent target set by the legislature, the Communist Party of Vietnam’s website said last week.“Vietnam has a huge level of natural gas reserves and a level of oil, so if the prices go up that would definitely be a boon for Vietnam,” said Ralf Matthaes, founder of the Infocus Mekong Research consultancy in Ho Chi Minh City.“It would be another benefit for Vietnam, that look, Vietnam has more exports. It’s not just about coffee and rice,” he said.The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance forecasts that total state revenue from crude oil exports will reach $3.13 billion in the first nine months of 2018, up 42.5% over the same period last year. The total for January through September would beat a full-year target.The revenue increases for Vietnam reflect higher income from oil sales worldwide. World prices should reach $73 per barrel within the year and $74 next year, per estimates by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",human
"Singapore has revised the cost of hosting the historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. According to a government statement, the city-state has agreed to bear the majority of the expenses incurred during the event.This includes the hospitality expenses for the North Korean delegation as well as other logistical costs. Singapore had previously indicated that it would cover the bill for the summit, calling it an “investment in peace”.The event, which took place on June 12, is thought to have cost Singapore about $16 million, although the exact amount is yet to be confirmed. This figure was reached after deducting the savings from security-related expenses, which were covered by the United States.The U.S. is grateful for Singapore’s contribution to the summit, according to a White House statement released today. President Trump has thanked Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his “fantastic hospitality and professionalism” and expressed his appreciation for Singapore’s role in the success of the summit.The summit, which was the first time a sitting U.S. president had met with a North Korean leader, resulted in a four-point joint declaration being signed by both leaders.

We risk losing many seats, especially in urban areas, where the majority of voters are not comfortable with Banda's record,"" Mpombo said.The MMD has been divided over the issue of whether to adopt Banda as its candidate in the 2011 elections. Some party officials have called for his return to the leadership of the party, while others have distanced themselves from him, citing his controversial exit from office.Banda's term ended in September this year, and he was succeeded by President Michael Sata, who won the presidential election held on October 31. Banda has since been accused of mismanaging public funds and using his powers to benefit himself and his associates.Mpombo said the MMD needed to focus on rebuilding its image and re-establishing its commitment to democratic principles, rather than relying on Banda's legacy to win the elections.""",ai_generated

"Zimbabwe's decision to ditch the U.S. dollar and adopt the Chinese Yuan as its reserve currency comes at a time of great economic uncertainty. The decision was announced earlier this month, with the new policy to take effect on April 26. Zimbabwe's economy has been in a steep decline, in part due to a longstanding currency crisis. The country has been using a slew of foreign currencies, including the South African Rand, U.S. Dollar and the Chinese Yuan, as a backup for its own domestic currency. This move is seen as a way to boost trade, increase international recognition and strengthen the country's foreign reserves. China has been active in recent years in strengthening its economic ties to African countries.

Johnson's farewell party was held that night, according to Foreign Policy.Johnson did not make a statement to the journal for its report, but Foreign Policy reports that his farewell email to colleagues and staff praised the deal, calling it an ""extraordinary achievement"" and saying it has ""clearly been successful in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.""Johnson's departure highlights the Trump administration's loss of high-level career diplomats at the State Department and across the breadth of the federal government. The report notes that the office Johnson headed has gone from a full-time staff of seven to none since Trump's inauguration.That development was due in part to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's decision to close the department's office in charge of coordinating sanctions and move some experts to administrative roles.Several former government employees contacted for the story, including former U.S.",human

These factors, she argued, justified a ""cautious approach"" to raising interest rates.""We should be aware of the potential consequences of our decisions for financial and economic stability, and should proceed cautiously as we adjust policy,"" Yellen said.The Federal Reserve has long been considering raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, as well as to maintain financial stability.

Markets reacted positively to her comments, with stocks rising and the dollar weakening against major currencies.The Fed Chair noted the strong growth in the US labor market, with unemployment decreasing and job creation on the rise. However, she expressed concerns about inflation remaining below the Fed's target of 2% and the potential impact of global economic developments on US monetary policy.""Our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy are based on what is best for the US economy, but we do, of course, carefully consider the likely effects of our decisions on other economies,"" Yellen said.Yellen's cautious approach is consistent with her previous statements, in which she has emphasized the need to be patient in raising interest rates. In addition, her comments reflect the concerns of other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are also grappling with low inflation and slow economic growth.Despite the cautious tone, Yellen remained optimistic about the future prospects of the US economy.""US economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the strong headwinds created by weak foreign economic growth and less accommodative financial conditions,"" Yellen said.The cautious approach to monetary policy will likely be a major topic of discussion at the upcoming G-20 meeting in Washington, as central bankers and finance ministers from around the world attempt to coordinate efforts to support global economic growth.",ai_generated

"RIO DE JANEIRO - The Brazilian government and responsible mining companies must do more to ensure access to safe drinking water after a dam burst at a mine in early November and polluted a major river, a United Nations official said on Tuesday.""The government must strengthen its monitoring of both raw and treated water, improve water treatment, and disseminate clear information to the population,"" Léo Heller, U.N. special rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, said in a statement.The burst dam released about 60 million cubic meters of water and thick mining waste, equivalent to 25,000 swimming pools, in Brazil's worst-ever environmental disaster. The mud flowed into the Rio Doce river, across two states, and into the Atlantic Ocean. At least 15 people were killed, and thousands of dead fish washed up on the river's banks.Several cities along the river had their water supply cut off as a result of the mud flow.Mine operator Samarco, which is co-owned by Brazil's Vale SA and Australia's BHP Billiton, trucked in water, but Heller said the actions were insufficient, and hundreds of thousands of people were still suffering interruptions to their water supply.""",human
"A recent report has revealed that being a Member of Parliament (MP) in Africa and Asia is the most dangerous job in the world.The report, which was commissioned by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), showed that threats to political representation are a major problem in many countries around the world.According to the report, countries in Africa and Asia have the highest rates of violence and intimidation against MPs. In total, around a quarter of the world's MPs report threats and violence against them as a result of their political activities.The report also found that while the majority of these incidents are verbal, some MPs have also faced physical attacks, including beatings, abductions, and even death threats.The IDEA report emphasized the need to protect MPs in order to ensure democratic representation and protect human rights. It concluded that governments must do more to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the violence and intimidation of MPs.The report also recommended that governments should adopt protective measures, such as providing better security for MPs, as well as training on protection mechanisms for MPs and their families.It is clear from this report that governments in Africa and Asia must take urgent action to address the issue of violence and intimidation against MPs and ensure democratic representation for all.",ai_generated
"The rise in piracy off the Somali coast has resulted in more global piracy cases in 2009 than in all of 2008, according to a maritime watchdog group. Despite the rise in attacks, the number of successful hijackings has fallen. The International Maritime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce, reports 306 piracy incidents have been reported in the first three quarters of 2009 compared to 293 reported in all of 2008. The group attributes the jumps in total attacks from last year to Somali pirates. Attacks in the Gulf of Aden have nearly doubled, and attacks east of the Somali coast have increased nearly four-fold. The piracy appears to be increasing in armed intensity as well. The group reports the number of attacks that involved the use of firearms has doubled from 2008. International Maritime Bureau Director Pottengal Mukundan sees a silver lining in the grim statistics. ""What is very interesting is that the number of vessels, which have been successfully hijacked, [has] gone down from the figures last year,"" Mukundan said.Mukundan attributes the drop in hijackings both to the greater use of international navy patrols in the dangerous waters, as well as better prepared crews who brave the risky shipping lanes. He says captains of these ships are learning how to out-savvy the pirates in case of an attack, using evasive tactics that keep the ship moving even as the pirates open fire. Somalis claim organized piracy developed out of efforts by local fisherman to protect against illicit overfishing by outsiders taking advantage of the country's inner turmoil.",human

""There are still many areas where women are denied basic rights, such as the right to drive, work in certain professions, and even leave the country without the permission of a male guardian.""The decree is seen as a significant change from the previous policies of King Salman's predecessor, King Abdullah, who was criticized for not doing enough to address the rights of women and other marginalized groups.

"The United States' much-anticipated Census Day arrived on Wednesday, April 1, 2020, but the country is reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. With most of the nation under some form of lockdown, it is unclear how many people will be able to participate in the Census this year. The once-a-decade count is used to determine the allocation of resources and representation in the government, making it crucially important for every resident to be counted.In an effort to adapt to the current situation, the US Census Bureau has extended the deadline for completing the Census from July 31 to August 14. However, with the number of confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus still rising, many people are hesitant to open their doors to Census takers or to fill out the survey online. The fear of infection has made it difficult for officials to gather accurate data on the population.As the crisis continues to unfold, some states have taken matters into their own hands. California, for example, has launched a ""Stay Home, Save Lives"" campaign that emphasizes the importance of participating in the Census online. Other states have also ramped up their efforts to encourage people to complete the survey from the safety of their homes.But with the economy in freefall and millions of people out of work, the Census may take a backseat to more pressing concerns for many Americans. The pandemic has exposed deep inequalities in the country, particularly in the areas of healthcare and social services.

"The United States has recently denied allegations that their new aid plan for Pakistan intrudes on the nation's sovereignty, emphasizing that the initiative is meant to strengthen bilateral relations and improve regional security. US officials have been quick to dismiss concerns that the aid package comes with strings attached, arguing that it is in the interest of both nations to cooperate on key issues such as counter-terrorism and economic development.The aid plan, which was announced earlier this month, includes a combination of military assistance, development funds, and economic aid for Pakistan. The primary goal of this initiative is to bolster the nation's counter-terrorism efforts and improve overall security in the region. Additionally, the plan aims to promote economic development and provide support for the struggling economy.Several Pakistani politicians and media outlets have criticized the plan, arguing that it represents a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and an unwanted interference in the nation's domestic affairs. These critics have expressed concerns that the aid package may come with hidden conditions that could undermine the country's autonomy.In response to these criticisms, US officials have firmly stated that the aid plan does not entail any interference in Pakistan's domestic matters and is solely aimed at supporting the country's efforts to combat terrorism and improve economic conditions. ""Our aid plan for Pakistan is based on mutual interests and shared goals, and does not intrude on the country's sovereignty,"" said a senior State Department official.Furthermore, US officials have reiterated that the aid plan is part of a broader strategy to strengthen regional security and ensure long-term stability in South Asia. ""Our cooperation with Pakistan is an essential element of our regional security strategy, and we are committed to working closely with the government and people of Pakistan to tackle the common challenges we face,"" said the official.Many experts see this aid plan as a vital step in rebuilding trust between the US and Pakistan, which has been strained in recent years due to various factors such as the US drone campaign in Pakistan's tribal areas and the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. However, others argue that it is crucial for both countries to be transparent about the terms of the aid package and ensure that the funds are used effectively.As the US continues to emphasize its commitment to working collaboratively with Pakistan to address regional security challenges, it remains to be seen how this aid plan will impact the relationship between the two countries in the long run.",ai_generated

"Copenhagen - In a move that has sparked controversy, the Danish government has announced plans to ban face veils in public places. The proposed ban, which is set to be introduced in the summer of 2023, would make it illegal for anyone to wear a face veil in public areas such as streets, parks, and public transportation.The move has been criticized by civil liberties groups and some politicians, who argue that it infringes on the right to freedom of expression and religion. However, supporters of the ban say that it is necessary to protect Danish values and to promote social cohesion.The ban is part of a wider effort by the Danish government to combat what it sees as the erosion of traditional Danish values. In recent years, the country has seen a significant influx of immigrants, many of whom come from Muslim-majority countries. This has led to a rise in the number of people wearing face veils in public.The ban is expected to be enforced with stiff penalties, including fines and even imprisonment for those who violate the law. It is unclear how the ban will be enforced, but officials have indicated that it will be up to police officers to determine whether someone is wearing a face veil in public.The issue of face veils has become a contentious one in many European countries in recent years, with some governments banning them in public places while others have taken a more permissive approach. The debate has been marked by heated arguments on both sides, with some arguing that face veils are a symbol of oppression and others insisting that they are a legitimate form of religious expression.The Danish government's proposed ban is likely to be closely watched by other European countries, many of which are grappling with similar issues.",ai_generated

The operation has been widely criticized by the international community, with concerns mounting over the humanitarian impact and the risk of increased violence in the region.The Turkish incursion has further complicated the already convoluted situation in northern Syria, with multiple actors vying for control over the territory. While Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies are seeking to establish a buffer zone along the border, the US-backed SDF has been attempting to consolidate its position in the region, with the ultimate aim of establishing a Kurdish autonomous administration.Ankara has repeatedly expressed its frustration at Washington's continued support for the SDF, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning in March that Turkish forces could potentially target US troops in northern Syria if they continue to support Kurdish forces.The US call for de-escalation comes ahead of a planned high-level meeting between Turkish and US officials, which is set to take place in the coming weeks. Both sides are expected to discuss a range of issues, including the Syrian crisis, counter-terrorism cooperation, and the strengthening of NATO's southeastern flank.Analysts say that the US request for de-escalation signals a renewed effort to defuse tensions with its NATO ally and to prevent the unraveling of an already fragile partnership.",ai_generated

But the Pakistani government says it will not retaliate against New Delhi's decision to recall its ambassador in Islamabad.In a statement issued Friday, Pakistan Foreign Ministry says it is deeply concerned over what it calls massive troop movements by India along the border (in the Sindh-Rajasthan Sector, in the Chenab-Ravi corridor) and on the military line of control dividing the disputed Kashmir region.The statement says such actions would aggravate an already tense situation in the region and Pakistan will be obliged to take, what it termed: ""all appropriate counter measures."" India says the military movement is a precautionary measure and a reaction to what it says is a large mobilization of Pakistani forces near the border.Tension between the two nations has increased after last week's terrorist attack on India's parliament building.

"US President Barack Obama's re-election campaign raised more than $181 million in the last three months, a record for the campaign. The haul far exceeds the $94.7 million raised by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during the same period and was the largest fundraising quarter for the president's re-election effort since he took office in 2008.The majority of the money, $53 million, came from small donors, defined by the campaign as those who gave less than $200 during the quarter. Another $47 million came from large donors and $78 million from events.The fundraising total, which surpassed Obama's initial target of $60 million for the quarter, was boosted by the Obama campaign's aggressive efforts to mobilize small donors. It included a two-day fundraising blitz in June, when Vice President Joe Biden and Obama himself appeared at a series of small-donor events in key states.Obama's fundraising pace is even more impressive given that his campaign opted not to accept contributions larger than $5,000, unlike Romney. Still, his total pales in comparison to the $1 billion Obama is expected to need to compete in a race against the deep-pocketed former Massachusetts governor.Despite the strong quarter, Obama's campaign may have to scale back on its aggressive small donor solicitations after it announced this week that it would stop accepting donations from unions and corporations.",ai_generated

He said church documents would reveal a playbook among bishops and other officials to protect offending clergy by keeping files under wraps and moving the priests across the country and, in some cases, out of the U.S.The lawsuit asks a judge ""to abate the continuing nuisance'' of abuse by ordering each diocese to name all accused priests, detail their history of alleged assault and identify their last known addresses.The California Catholic Conference of Bishops, which oversees the state's 12 dioceses, didn't directly address the lawsuit in a statement Tuesday afternoon.",human

"Governments around the world are beginning to see the economic benefit of investing in re-growing forests. As climate change increasingly affects the planet, efforts to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and restore forests and ecosystems have become increasingly important. Recent studies have suggested that these efforts can have a positive economic impact as well.According to one study, planting trees can generate five times more jobs than any other sector in the same amount of land. Additionally, re-growing forests could provide almost 4.5 million direct jobs worldwide, while indirect jobs in industries such as timber, paper, tourism, and conservation could total up to 60 million.Moreover, regrowing forests can help to reduce air pollution, prevent soil erosion, and improve water quality. In some cases, such efforts have led to increased agricultural yields due to better soil and water quality. Furthermore, it has been estimated that, over the next 30 years, re-growing forests could bring in up to $2.3 trillion in economic benefits. The message is clear: governments should look at re-growing forests not only as a way to fight climate change, but also as an economic opportunity that could benefit their countries in the long run.",ai_generated

"By Dora MlamboCAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA - A new report says the world has seen a lot of progress for women and girls over the past 20 years, but there's still much room for improvement in gender equality.The ""Turning Promises Into Action: Gender Equality in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development"" report was released this week by the United Nations Women, as women worldwide prepare to mark the international women's day on Thursday.The report documents women's struggle to reach full equality, with a call for political action to advance gender equality.It says over the past 20 years, some significant progress has been made in the world with 106 countries now having laws that guarantee equal pay, compared to 76 countries 20 years ago.Tarun Sarwal, research and data specialist at the United Nations Women, says while there has been major improvement over the last 20 years, there are still major gaps that need to be addressed.The report notes that women's movements, advocates and activists worldwide have been pushing for gender equality since the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.""It is time to mobilize and reinforce global support for the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, fully utilize its powerful promise and potential,"" said U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a statement.""Its comprehensive approach and holistic view of women's empowerment and gender equality make the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as relevant today as it was 20 years ago,"" he said.He noted that progress has been made.""More women have been elected to public office - about 22 percent of all national parliamentarians are women, and 10 women are serving as Head of State or Government. Maternal deaths have declined by 45 percent; in the majority of developing countries, girls are now more likely to start school than boys.""But he added that there is still ""much work to do to address the structural barriers to gender equality and women's empowerment.""",ai_generated

The sudden increase in such calls has caused disruptions to the normal functioning of the helpline and wasted the time and resources of immigration officials who are tasked with handling genuine concerns and inquiries.The issue gained public attention when some of the prank callers took to social media to brag about their antics, with several screenshots and recordings of the calls going viral. Callers claimed to have seen ""little green men with antennas"" or ""intergalactic travelers in flying saucers"" arriving at various entry points across the country. Some even went as far as providing elaborate descriptions of the supposed alien ""invasion.""The immigration hotline, which was established to assist individuals in reporting illegal immigration and related concerns, has since become a target for those wishing to make light of the situation.

Shanahan, who assumed the role following the resignation of Jim Mattis, stated that a long-term solution is needed to address the issue of illegal immigration.Shanahan has been working with the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan that focuses on a combination of physical barriers, technology, and personnel. He emphasized the need for a secure border while avoiding a situation where the military is continuously providing aid.President Donald Trump has been pushing for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and has threatened to declare a national emergency if Congress does not approve funding. Shanahan did not directly address the issue of a wall, but rather focused on a comprehensive approach that includes additional resources for border patrol agents and technology to detect illegal crossings.The Acting Secretary of Defense also emphasized the importance of addressing the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and violence in Central America. He stated that the U.S. needs to work with other countries in the region to address these issues.Shanahan's comments come as the government shutdown, caused by a disagreement over funding for the border wall, continues into its fourth week. The shutdown has affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers and caused significant disruptions to government operations.It remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to Shanahan's approach to securing the border.

The procedure has no health benefits and can lead to a range of physical and psychological complications, including severe pain, excessive bleeding, infection, urinary problems, and even death.

That may be ending as a result of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Republicans favored Donald Trump even after he acknowledged not knowing the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah. And they didn't fret over Ben Carson's mistaken belief that the Chinese are involved in the Syrian conflict. Yet Friday's terrorist rampage in Paris sparked an urgent focus on national security that will test the appeal of the outsiders like nothing they've faced so far. Their lack of governing experience - an asset for much of the year as people rebelled against the establishment - now represents a question mark for Americans suddenly anxious about the nation's security and the prospect of another war. ‘Real crisis situation’“This is real life, a real crisis situation, and it reminds people of the importance of having a serious person as commander in chief,” said Dan Senor, a foreign policy adviser for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and unaligned in 2016. “In a race where there are some serious candidates and some less-than-serious candidates, one would think that a distinction would be made.” Senor declined to name the “less-than-serious” candidates, but the inference was clear.

He urged local officials to exercise ""full-on supervision and punishment"", as well as strengthen their legal enforcement capabilities.""Without punishing polluters and enhancing the effectiveness of enforcement, our achievements in promoting green development will amount to nothing,"" he said.Li concluded his speech by emphasizing the importance of ""the rule of law"" and strong enforcement in the fight against pollution.

These new images, captured by the agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, provide unprecedented detail of the outer layers of the Sun, and are revealing many previously unseen phenomena.NASA's images, which were released on Monday, are the culmination of more than two decades of work, and have been made possible by new technology that enables scientists to map the Sun's magnetic field and its solar atmosphere, the corona. This technology is revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun, and of the effects it has on the solar system and beyond.NASA's new solar maps are already yielding valuable insight into solar dynamics and the complex web of plasma and magnetic fields that shape the Sun's dynamic and ever-changing structure. Furthermore, they provide scientists with new ways of predicting space weather and its effects on our planet, providing a better understanding of how solar activity can affect spacecraft and astronauts, and how it may influence climate change on Earth.The images also show that the Sun's atmosphere is more complex than previously thought, with the Sun's magnetic field producing unexpected behavior, including strange and complex loops, twists and magnetic knots.Solar scientists are still analyzing the images, but are already learning more about the Sun's complicated and dynamic behavior, and its effect on the solar system and beyond.

Before arriving in Beijing Tuesday, Secretary Clinton told reporters in Jakarta that Washington was looking for solutions that would bring peace, stability and respect for freedom of navigation in the region.But it was Clinton’s suggestion that Southeast Asian nations put up a united front that has China riled.While aggressively staking out 75 percent of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory, Beijing has said it will only negotiate with countries individually. It’s a position that gives China obvious advantages in dealings with smaller nations.While negotiations have been a non-starter, there have been stand-offs involving military vessels. Heated words from Vietnam and the Philippines aimed at China’s moves have caused alarm in the region.Tensions have been exacerbated by the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia,” which Beijing is beginning to take as a challenge to its own interests there.Finding a quick resolution satisfactory to all the competing interests in the South China Sea is gathering increasing importance.“The problem is that both sides are nearing red lines that have been drawn, so the margin for error is narrowing,” said David Arase, Professor of Politics at Pomona College and the Hopkins-Nanjing Center at Nanjing University.“",human

Some call this Moscow-centered group “Soviet Lite.” But as a sea of black business suits filled the 3,000-seat Palace of Independence in Astana, Moscow’s big prize was absent: Ukraine.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko broke protocol, and bluntly lamented that Ukraine had “dropped out.” ""Sooner or later,"" he said, ""I'm sure one day the leaders of Ukraine will understand where the country's happiness lies.” Russian President Vladimir Putin was more diplomatic. For the last year, he has worked - overtly and covertly - to bring Ukraine back into Moscow’s sphere of influence. “The transfer of certain powers to national bodies of the (Eurasian Economic) Union brings absolutely no harm to the sovereignty of our states,” said Putin.",human

But the driving factor behind their innovations is to ensure there’s enough to eat. “When you find out in a country like Kenya that a huge percentage of households are still struggling to feed their family from any source at all – from markets, from food aid, from their own farms, from any source for several months a year, you have to say, oh my goodness.

Kristjanson took part in a study by CGIAR’s Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. “I’ve been working with farmers across Africa for 25 years now and they’ve always been making changes and trying different things and testing new approaches and switching what they do and trying new crops, for example, or new varieties,” she said.

In every region in Turkey, everyone complains about joblessness. Unemployment is very high among the youth. This is the major hurdle that has to be dealt with. On the other hand, the current polices [of the government] are causing unemployment to grow further, instead of helping it diminish.

He said IS propaganda statements acknowledged the loss of territory and asked potential recruits to go to Libya instead of Syria.Asked about the status of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, McGurk said he had ""no reason to believe that he is not still alive,"" though he has not had any public appearances since late last year.McGurk said that as the self-proclaimed leader of a caliphate, Baghdadi normally would have been expected to speak to his followers at the start of the holy month of Ramadan. He said Baghdadi’s reticence to appear in public showed that the group’s confidence was waning.The envoy did not mention unconfirmed reports by a local source in Iraq alleging that Baghdadi and other Islamic State leaders were wounded Thursday in a coalition airstrike on one of their command headquarters near the Syrian border.",human

He warns that if residents of Tehran and nearby provinces do not reduce their consumption “we will have a problem.” Officials say if water consumption is not cut back they will consider options such as scheduling water outages for high consuming households, and lowering water pressure in Tehran’s pipeline network that serves an estimated 22 million people. It’s not only Tehran that is facing a water crisis. The deputy head of Iran’s water and sewage company recently warned that “500 cities in Iran are facing a water crisis.” In early February, Iran’s energy minister Hamid Chitchian said the country's water supply has dropped by 20-percent over the past year.

In these countries, MPs are often targeted by extremist groups or criminal organizations because of their position.The report also found that other professions, such as journalists, doctors, and aid workers, are also at high risk of violence in some countries.However, the report notes that there are significant differences in the levels of violence and instability across different regions and countries.For example, while being an MP may be one of the most dangerous professions in Africa and Asia, it is generally considered to be a safe profession in countries such as Canada and Sweden.The report concludes that political violence and instability are major challenges for many countries around the world, and that efforts should be made to improve security for MPs and other professionals at risk of violence.In some countries, such as Somalia and Afghanistan, this may require significant reforms to the political and security systems, the report says.Overall, the report provides a valuable insight into the challenges faced by MPs and other professionals in different parts of the world, and underscores the importance of improving security and reducing violence in these countries.",ai_generated

The absence of more stringent measures, such as restrictions on major events, festivals and holidays, and the absence of quick and precise tests to identify suspect cases, has led to a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases. The Ombudsman, the body that monitors public health in France, has admitted that there is no evidence that light confinement has been effective in reducing the spread of the virus.

However, the Likud party seems to be trying to undercut his credibility by suggesting that he is mentally unstable.The ad has sparked controversy and backlash from Lapid's supporters, who accuse Likud of stooping to dirty tactics. Lapid himself has dismissed the ad, saying that it is an attempt to distract from Netanyahu's record and the real issues at stake in the election.Mental health has become a sensitive topic in Israeli politics, particularly after the recent suicide of a prominent IDF veteran who had been suffering from PTSD.

We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks even, but we're getting them changed one by one.""The facts: He's actually failed to achieve changes in immigration laws. All of the immigration-related changes pushed by his administration were done by executive order, not legislation, or through policy shifts like the zero-tolerance policy that criminally prosecuted anyone caught crossing illegally and gave rise to family separations. The administration has also used regulations to tighten the rules on how immigrants can receive public benefits. Immigration legislation has failed despite Republican control of the White House and both houses of Congress.Trump, on the separation of children from their parents at the border: ""Now President Obama had the same law. He did the same thing.""The facts: Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy. It's true the underlying laws were the same. But the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted.

The country’s economy saw a serious meltdown after the shutdown of the oil sector and there have been widespread fears that the country could soon run out of funds.

"LAS VEGAS - Former President Barack Obama delivered a biting critique of Republicans in Washington and President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday but avoided mentioning his successor by name.Obama, speaking at a rally in Las Vegas for Nevada Democrats, said Republicans had promised to “fight for the little guy” but instead helped corporations and sowed divisions in America.Republicans in Congress “bend over backwards” instead of being “a check or a balance on this kind of corrupt politics,” the former president said.Obama was in Nevada to drum up support for Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who is in a tight race against incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, and energize voters in the swing state who delivered big for Democrats in 2016 but stayed home during the midterm elections in 2014.Obama, who won the state in 2008 and 2012, railed against the GOP tax law, efforts to repeal his Affordable Care Act, Trump’s attacks on the media, political pressure he’s put on U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the separation of immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border.Obama also criticized Heller, saying, “the current senator, he doesn’t seem to be willing to stand up to this. He just goes along, even when you get a sense he knows it’s not right.”",human

"Human rights groups are criticizing Gambia for hosting an African Union (AU) Rights Commission meeting, citing the country's poor human rights record.The AU Rights Commission had scheduled its meeting in Gambia's capital Banjul from June 13 to 16. However, with Gambia still in the process of transitioning out of a decade of authoritarian rule, human rights groups are voicing their concerns.Gambia, which is a member of the AU, has been repeatedly accused of human rights violations, including the suppression of press freedom, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Under the rule of former president Yahya Jammeh, the country had one of the worst human rights records in Africa.Gambian authorities have taken steps to improve the country's human rights record since Jammeh was ousted from power in 2017. Nevertheless, human rights groups are cautioning against hosting the event in the country.International NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have warned the AU that hosting the meeting in Gambia sends the wrong message. They said that holding the event there before concrete steps are taken to address human rights violations sends a signal that Gambia is not taking its human rights obligations seriously.The AU is expected to make a final decision on where to host the meeting, but human rights groups are hoping that Gambia's hosting of the event will be reconsidered.",ai_generated
"The Russian Ruble has been gaining ground against the US dollar in recent days as higher oil prices, higher taxes on financial transactions, and a large amount of carry trade are lending support.Crude oil prices have risen over 6% so far this year, and the ruble has reacted favorably in recent days, gaining more than 0.9% against the dollar. This is due in part to increased taxes on financial transactions announced by the Russian Central Bank, which makes trading in foreign currencies much more expensive.The carry trade, which is when investors borrow in one currency and invest in another to make a profit, has also been a major driving force behind the ruble's recent upturn. Because of the higher interest rates in Russia compared to the United States and other developed countries, investors have been taking advantage of the situation and putting their money into the ruble.The Russian economy, which has been struggling due to Western sanctions, has also been supported by the price of crude oil. While most analysts don't expect oil prices to stay high for long, the rally has added some buoyancy to the currency.Overall, the ruble has been performing well over the past few days and appears to be headed for more gains in the coming weeks. Whether the uptrend will be sustained over the long term remains to be seen.",ai_generated
"in Namibia.By Elena Sautkina, University of South CarolinaJune 2012 -- This June, members of the Kimberley Process (KP), an international certification scheme governing the trade of diamonds, will gather in the picturesque coastal city of Swakopmund, Namibia for their annual meeting. At issue are the human rights abuses and smuggling associated with Zimbabwe's Marange diamond field, one of Africa's most valuable diamond deposits.Zimbabwe's 2012 exports through the KP were expected to reach 15 million carats valued at $600 million. Diamonds from Marange were thought to be able to fund half of the country's total budget.At stake in Swakopmund is whether Zimbabwe will remain eligible to export rough diamonds to the United States. Currently the United States has granted Zimbabwe's diamond exports an exception to the KP's sanctions, but U.S. authorities can withdraw this exception at any time.The situation is reminiscent of that of 2010, when U.S. authorities rejected Zimbabwe's exports after KP members failed to reach a decision on whether to certify the Marange diamonds.During the months leading up to the meeting, some KP members, such as South Africa, will attempt to reach an agreement with the Zimbabwean authorities and the civil society to establish a legitimate monitoring and enforcement system.However, the possibility of compromise is slim, given that South Africa has only been recently elected to the KP's chairmanship after Zimbabwe was stripped of it due to the military's involvement in mining Marange diamonds. As I recently found in the course of my doctoral research at the University of Chicago, governments are significantly more reluctant to punish countries for noncompliance with human rights if they have a history of conflict with the target country.",ai_generated

"to SDFMOSCOW — The Islamic State commander accused by the Syrian Democratic Forces of raping a Yazidi woman in a video that went viral last month surrendered to S.D.F. fighters in eastern Syria on Thursday, a spokesman for the S.D.F. said.The commander, whose identity was not disclosed, and his followers surrendered to the S.D.F. under a cease-fire deal with the jihadists in an area northeast of the Syrian city of Deir al-Zour.His surrender is part of a broader deal under which S.D.F. fighters have evacuated their positions in the village of Baghouz, where they had been encircled and besieged by the jihadists, and left for the northern province of Aleppo.In exchange for evacuating the village, the S.D.F. agreed to release the captured fighters, the commander among them. He and his followers were flown out to a desert area in Aleppo Province and transported to a S.D.F. camp.The video of the Yazidi woman being raped was first posted on Telegram channels linked to the Islamic State and later on YouTube and Twitter.

"Title: In a recent interview, the top US House Intelligence Committee lawmaker expressed grave concerns over the security of the upcoming 2020 US Presidential Elections. Chairman Adam Schiff highlighted that the country's election infrastructure remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, and raised apprehensions about potential interference from foreign adversaries.This comes in the wake of a series of high-profile cyber attacks on US government institutions and major companies in the past few years, notably the 2016 US Presidential Election interference by Russian hackers. Schiff argued that, despite efforts to secure election infrastructure, further improvements must be made to avoid disastrous consequences.""We're enormously vulnerable, and that's not just about foreign threats but also from those with a domestic agenda,"" Schiff said in the interview. ""We've seen, for example, some of our adversaries test their tools on other countries or against private industries before bringing them to bear in the US.""US intelligence agencies have warned that countries such as Russia, China, and Iran are constantly seeking ways to interfere in the nation's electoral processes.

Now scientists are trying to save the species by cloning them https://t.co/3XzsW4g3RV — CNN (@CNN) August 23, 2018It was hoped the remaining northern white rhino – another female called Najin – would act as a surrogate, but scientists have now decided to attempt to artificially inseminate her, to save her offspring from going the same way as their father.‘Saving the northern white rhino from extinction is a major challenge, but I am sure we can achieve it,’ Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, told BBC News.‘After many years of trying, we now have the basic knowledge and expertise to do this.’The next stage will involve fertilising the eggs produced with sperm from a southern white rhino in a lab, before they are implanted in a southern white rhino surrogate.While there are only two females left of their kind alive, five have previously been born and raised to the age of 18. Four of these females are still alive, but only two have proven to be fertile.As the world’s population of rhinos plummets towards extinction, with many poaching for their horns, the researchers are aiming to use in vitro fertilization and a surrogate to bring a viable northern white rhino back from the brink.In 2017, only 28 individuals of all five species of rhino were estimated to be left in the wild, mostly in Africa.",ai_generated

"In the early 1990s, satellite dishes were on the rise in the region as it emerged from more than three decades of economic sanctions and political oppression. These dishes helped the region make a quick transition to the new, vibrant information society that emerged during the years after the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union fell.Today, only Egypt and Iran remain satellite-free countries in the Middle East and Gulf region. Even North Africa, the cradle of civilization, has embraced the satellite and other types of communications technology.Gulf countries have long made strides in communications, and the latest, the UAE, may boast the best communications infrastructure anywhere in the region. But this is one area where much work remains to be done. Many Gulf countries face a communications infrastructure gap that is costing them economic opportunity, investment and security.This is not lost on the region’s government and political leaders, nor on foreign investors and consumers. Many companies in Europe and the U.S. are looking to Gulf nations as prime markets for satellite and cellular communications services. And the region’s leaders know that communications is key to attracting investment, and thus crucial to building the modern economy.But even though Gulf nations are making much progress in the field, the gap remains wide and will not easily be closed. In terms of communications, the region is still a communications black hole.It’s true that almost all Gulf nations have fixed landline service, as well as wireless mobile service. But for businesses or government officials who need access to their information while they travel or are out of the office, or if they need to communicate with people in other countries, these services are far from ideal.A cell phone service or a landline are good when someone is working at the office, but bad when that person is traveling or out of the office, away from the main telephone office or its landline service. If a business needs a high level of communications with someone in another country or with customers or suppliers in another country, a wireless phone service is not an option.",ai_generated

"PARIS — The debate about third- and fourth-generation birth control pills is growing in France. In recent years, these contraceptives have been associated with an increased risk of blood clots, which can lead to serious health complications such as stroke, pulmonary embolism and thrombosis. Controversy has come to the French Parliament, which is debating the possibility of restricting the use of these pills. Some medical organizations and consumer groups are already calling for these contraceptives to be taken off the market. Because third- and fourth-generation pills are more modern and offer fewer side effects than previous pills, they're not significantly more effective. So many experts say that women should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits before they choose these contraceptives. In that regard, many women are looking for alternatives to the pill, such as IUDs, condoms and natural family planning methods. What's important is that they don't overwhelm us. ",machine_translated

"HONG KONG - In a widely anticipated move, a court in China upheld a four-year jail term given to legal scholar Xu Zhiyong for his political activism. Xu is the founder of a transparency movement that has pressed officials to disclose their assets. His detention and prison sentence have drawn international criticism. Xu Zhiyong had been found guilty in January of gathering a crowd to disturb public order. His appeal, rejected on Friday by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, is the last legal recourse in his case. Xu, who now faces four years in prison, called the ruling “ridiculous” and told the court Friday that “the haze of Communist autocracy will fade away.” Xu's lawyer Zhang Qingfang said that although he expected a rejection, he had maintained hope that the members of the court would use this appeal as an opportunity to correct their earlier mistake. He said that the court had a very good opportunity but did not take it; a misjudgment on their part. A well-respected scholar of law, Xu Zhiyong has spent the last decade championing a moderate approach to political reform in China. More recently, together with other members of a loosely organized group called the New Citizens Movement, he had been advocating for better measures to fight corruption among officials, increase transparency, and guarantee equal access to education and jobs. The group held regular meetings to discuss politics and some members organized small scale demonstrations around the country. Prosecutors who charged him in 2013 said Xu Zhiyong used the issue of asset disclosure and education equality to gather hundreds of people in different rallies and create chaos in the streets of Beijing.",human

However, there is still hope for Africa to boost its wheat production.Several governments and organisations have been working together to find ways to help countries in Africa produce more wheat. According to the United Nations, many African nations are still heavily dependent on imports of wheat. In order to ensure food security and increase the domestic production of wheat, several initiatives have been launched.One such initiative is the 'Wheat Initiative', a global project that is seeking to increase wheat production in Africa and other developing countries. The project is expected to improve the quality of wheat varieties, increase access to high quality and improved seed, and encourage the use of improved management practices, among other things.Another project which is making strides in increasing wheat production in Africa is the Global Yield Gap and Water Productivity Atlas (GYGA).

"Indonesia is facing a severe threat to its biodiversity due to a growing illegal wildlife trade, according to environmental experts and activists. Indonesia is known for its rich biological diversity, with thousands of species of plants, animals, and marine life. However, the demand for exotic wildlife products is driving an underground market that is putting many of these species at risk.The illegal wildlife trade is a global issue, with Indonesia being one of the most heavily impacted countries. According to TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, this illegal trade is worth billions of dollars each year. It's fueled by international demand for exotic pets, traditional medicines, souvenirs, and luxury items made from rare animal parts, such as ivory and rhino horns.Many animal species native to Indonesia are being hunted and captured to be sold in this illegal trade. Among them are the Sumatran tiger, Javan rhinoceros, orangutans, and numerous species of birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Some of these species are already facing extinction due to habitat loss, and the illegal trade is only exacerbating the problem.Conservationists are also concerned that the illegal wildlife trade is leading to the spread of diseases, as animals are often captured and transported without proper care, leading to the spread of illnesses such as avian influenza and the potentially deadly SARS virus.The Indonesian government has taken steps to combat this illegal trade, with law enforcement agencies working in collaboration with international organizations such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and INTERPOL. This has resulted in several high-profile arrests and seizures of illegal wildlife products. However, much more needs to be done to effectively tackle this problem.Experts argue that there is an urgent need to raise awareness among the Indonesian public about the negative impacts of the illegal wildlife trade on their country's biodiversity. They also stress the need for stronger legislation and harsher penalties for those caught engaging in this illegal trade, as well as increased resources for law enforcement and conservation efforts.The international community also has a role to play in curbing the demand for illegally obtained wildlife products. This includes promoting responsible tourism practices, strengthening international cooperation, and supporting efforts to reduce demand for these products.If the illegal wildlife trade continues to thrive in Indonesia, the consequences could be devastating, not only for the country's biodiversity but also for the global environment.",ai_generated

"A new study reveals cave art could be the creation of Neanderthals and not our own ancestors, Homo sapiens. If true, the study could upend our understanding of Neanderthals, and the origin of modern art. Scientists studying the art believe it may be 20,000 older than modern humans inhabited Europe, leading them to conclude it was made by Neanderthals.Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and the British Museum in London have been studying a series of 13 paintings that appear on the walls of the Cavern of El Castillo in Northern Spain. They believe the age of the art could place its creation in the hands of Neanderthals, as anatomically modern humans would not have inhabited Europe until 40,800 years ago. The study was published in the journal Science.According to the study, a red disk was painted on the cave wall at least 40,800 years ago, indicating that Neanderthals may have had the capacity for symbolic thought. Until now, it was assumed Homo sapiens were responsible for cave art, as Neanderthals lacked the capacity for thought and imagination. If true, the study would change the way we think about our Neanderthal ancestors.The study used two different dating methods to discover the age of the art. First, researchers tried to date the calcite deposits formed on top of the art. In one instance, they were able to remove samples from the surface to be dated. However, in the rest of the cases, the artwork had been touched up and so the surface could not be tested. Instead, researchers drilled tiny holes into the art and then tested the calcite deposited on the backs of the paintings to determine their age.The study also tested other artwork around the world, comparing it to the Spanish cave paintings. While the Spanish artwork is the oldest, other cave art found in France and Indonesia was found to be at least 37,000 years old.",ai_generated

The plan was announced by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.Conte explained that the patrol vessels will monitor the waters to disrupt and prevent smugglers from sending vessels carrying migrants across the sea. He added that the patrols will ensure the safety of those attempting to migrate while also protecting Italy's national security. The patrols will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian Coast Guard. The deployment of naval patrols is part of a broader package of measures intended to address the flow of migrants and refugees from North Africa. These measures also include an agreement with the Libyan coast guard to intercept boats carrying migrants, support for migrants in Libya, and a commitment to increase aid for African countries where many of the migrants originate.The increased focus on patrolling the Mediterranean Sea comes amid ongoing tension between Italy and France over how to deal with the influx of migrants. Macron has criticized Italy for refusing to take in boats of migrants, while Italy has argued for a more comprehensive approach to the issue. The announcement of the naval patrols marks a shift in strategy as Italy attempts to gain control over the number of migrants arriving in the country. If successful, it could provide a much-needed solution to the ongoing crisis.",ai_generated

"Iran Vows 'Expected, Unexpected' Moves if Nuclear Deal DiesIranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Saturday that Tehran could adopt ""expected and unexpected"" measures if the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), collapses. The statement comes amidst rising tensions between Iran and the West after the United States' withdrawal from the accord in 2018, followed by Europe's inability to shield Iran's economy from the impact of US sanctions.In a ceremony marking National Nuclear Technology Day in Tehran, Rouhani said, ""If the JCPOA faces any problem due to the actions of the Americans or the Europeans, Iran will surely take the expected and unexpected measures."" He added that Iran has the capability to make necessary decisions based on its national interests and to respond to any potential threat.The 2015 deal was signed by Iran and six major powers, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. The agreement aimed to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. After former US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal and the reimposition of sanctions, Iran gradually breached the pact by ramping up its uranium enrichment and increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium.The Biden administration has expressed its willingness to rejoin the deal, but both Washington and Tehran are at loggerheads over who should take the first step. The US insists that Iran must reverse its nuclear violations before sanctions are lifted, while Tehran demands the removal of sanctions as a precondition for returning to compliance.European diplomats from Britain, France, and Germany, collectively known as the E3, have been trying to mediate between the two sides to salvage the deal. Last week, the E3 proposed a step-by-step approach to bring Iran and the US back into compliance with the agreement. Iran's foreign ministry, however, rejected the proposal, stating that the US must lift all sanctions at once to revive the deal.Despite the impasse, there are signs that both sides are open to diplomacy. The US and Iran recently participated in indirect talks in Vienna, with European diplomats acting as intermediaries. The aim of the discussions was to identify specific steps that each side should take in order to return to the JCPOA.Nevertheless, the progress of the talks remains uncertain, as both Iran and the US face domestic political pressure.",ai_generated

"NEW YORK — A senior United Nations official said Wednesday that Kofi Annan's replacement as the U.N.-Arab League peace envoy for Syria faces an impossible job. But French Ambassador Gerard Araud, who is president of the Security Council this month, noted that the United Nations can serve as a neutral channel for possible negotiations. Araud said any candidate for the position of peace envoy to Syria will face a deeply divided Security Council, as well as fighting in Syria with no immediate prospects for a political transition. Araud said that makes the job nearly an impossible mission and that he understands why people are hesitant to take on the role of Syrian peace envoy. He expressed hope that circumstances will change. “At some moment, for example, there could be the realization by the regime [the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] that you won’t crush the opposition, that you will have to negotiate,"" said Araud. ""And if it reaches this moment, I think the U.N. is the only channel for which we could have a negotiation.""

And during the production he began stripping away all of the conventions of normal melodrama because he was working on this 70mm giant widescreen Cinerama process and the movie progressively became more immersive. And the more immersive it became and the more experiential it became the less you had to talk about it,"" says Trumbull.To create this immersive experience Kubrick built ""a centrifuge set, the big center piece of the movie"" as Trumbull describes it.The cameras were tied on the rotating set and were filming in 360 degrees.

Even a narrow victory for the ""Remain"" campaign doesn’t preclude the chance of Cameron having to depart because of Conservative unruliness and bitter ill-feeling left by the often sharply personal so-called blue-on-blue attacks between Conservatives.Cameron has insisted there will be no reason for him to resign as party leader and prime minister, even if a majority of the British shun his advice and vote to exit the European Union.Speaking last month, he argued his authority would remain intact because he would be fulfilling what he promised in the party’s last election manifesto: to hold a referendum and abide by the voters' decision. “The question on the ballot paper is very clear: it is stay in or go. It is not this politician’s future or that politician’s future,” he said.But few party members think he can hang on in the event of a ‘Leave’ victory or a slim vote to ‘Remain,’ and sooner or later he will go.Ken Clarke, a Thatcher-era minister and Tory stalwart, says Cameron would not “last 30 seconds” in the event of a ""Leave"" vote.

"The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) has called on the government to urgently implement a land reform policy in the country.

The government has set a target of redistributing 30% of the land by 2030, but progress has been slow, with only about 7% of the land redistributed since the end of apartheid in 1994.COSATU's call for a quick land reform policy comes as the ruling African National Congress (ANC) is considering amending the constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation. The proposal has been met with fierce opposition from some quarters, with critics arguing that it could lead to a Zimbabwe-style land grab and undermine property rights.The ANC has said that any land reform policy will be implemented in a ""sustainable and orderly manner"" and will take into account the need to maintain food security, protect the environment and ensure economic growth.

"for Agricultureby Michael J. Cribbs on July 28, 2015 in Global EnvironmentA new project to plant millions of seeds in West Africa is a major innovation to support the agricultural transformation that is needed to feed the world’s growing population.At the same time, some of the world’s farmers are finding a way to overcome the challenges of climate change. With the support of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), local farmers have planted billions of seeds on 30,000 farms. In some areas, the farmers are converting old roads into farm fields and are finding new paths for crop diversification.A total of 5 million new varieties of seed have been planted in the area.West Africa is the second largest growing region after the Indian subcontinent. In 2012, the FAO estimated that 1.4 billion people (half of the world’s population) lived in the region. In sub-Saharan Africa, food prices have risen and there is a growing demand for high quality, affordable foods and fresh fruits and vegetables. At the same time, the soil in these areas has been degraded, with the use of excessive fertilizer. Overuse of pesticides has also been linked to the spread of deadly pests such as listeria in food production systems.To combat this challenge, the FAO has made three strategic investments. In addition to direct funding, the agency is working with partners to support the expansion of crop diversity, improve crop productivity, and improve water use and management. The first step in the effort is to enhance seed collection across the country. This can only be accomplished with the support of African farmers. So far, local farmers have been the key players.“The farmers are the key actors in this project,” explains Daboh, who coordinates seed collection for the FAO. “Many farmers are now engaged in collecting seeds on their own or with the support of the community.”The project involves a total of $150 million. The aim is to increase the diversity and production of local crops and increase food security, improve food processing and nutrition, and increase markets for local food.According to Daboh, the project is a game changer that will help to transform the livelihoods of millions of West African farmers.",ai_generated

"Two discoveries over the course of more than 40 years are now getting credit for revolutionizing the way scientists look at saving and creating life. The Nobel Prize committee Monday awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Britain's John Gurdon and Japan's Shinya Yamanaka for those discoveries in their work with cells, often called the building blocks of life.Sarah Williams talks with retired professor Peter Braude about the Nobel Medicine prizeFirst Gurdon and then Yamanaka showed that mature, specialized cells could be reprogrammed, causing them to revert to an immature, embryonic state and then turned into a different type of specialized cell.Nobel Prize in Medicine 2012 WinnersThe implications are enormous, allowing researchers to work on technology that could one day allow doctors to fight disease by regrowing tissue in damaged brains, hearts or other organs. ""This year's Nobel Prize awards a discovery that has changed the way we understand how cells in the body become specialized,"" said Thomas Perlmann, Professor of Molecular Development Biology of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""It has provided entirely new tools for effective development of drugs and new therapies."" Until recently, many scientists thought the only viable way to do this was to use embryonic human stem cells, which involved the destruction of a human embryo. The discoveries also set the stage for work on advanced cloning techniques and other technologies involved in creating life itself. ""This brings me great joy, but at the same time I feel a great sense of responsibility,"" said Yamanaka, now at Japan's Kyoto University. ""Stem cell research is still a very new field.''",human
"Border wall prototypes stand in San Diego near the Mexico-U.S. border as President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats are locked in a standoff over border wall funding that has shut down parts of the U.S. government.The impasse over government funding began last week, when the Senate approved a bipartisan deal keeping government open into February. That bill provided $1.3 billion for border security projects but not money for the wall. At Trump's urging, the House approved that package and inserted the $5.7 billion he had requested.But Republicans in the Senate lacked the 60 votes needed to force the measure with the wall funding through their chamber. That jump-started negotiations between Congress and the White House, but the deadline came and went without a deal.Trump, who was elected in 2016, campaigned on a promise to build a “big, beautiful wall” made of concrete, rebar and steel across the length of the southern border. He said he would make Mexico pay for it, but Mexico has refused.Lawmakers have limited the administration to replacing or strengthening existing barrier designs, rather than building Trump's new wall prototypes.In budget year 2017, Congress provided $292 million to the Department of Homeland Security to build a steel-bollard wall to replace “ineffective” barriers along the border with Mexico. More than 31 of 40 miles have been constructed, and nine more are scheduled to be completed by 2019.",human

The contest for the seat, vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, gained national attention as a referendum on the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Vote tallies for the incredibly close race ran into the night as Ossoff told supporters the fight would go on if he did not secure the 50 percent+1 vote majority needed to win outright. “We have defied the odds, we have shattered expectations. We are changing the world and your voices are going to ring out across this state and across this country,” he said late Tuesday. President Trump saw the close contest very differently, tweeting just moments later that “Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG ‘R’ win with runoff in Georgia.”The president weighed in on the high-stakes election earlier Tuesday, predicting “Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress. VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes.

"The United States military has announced plans to deploy an additional 1,500 soldiers to Germany by late 2020. This move comes as part of the military's larger strategy to strengthen its presence in Europe and boost its capabilities for rapid deployment. Currently, there are approximately 34,500 American troops stationed in Germany, making it the largest contingent of US soldiers outside the United States. The new deployment will bring the total number of US soldiers in Germany to around 36,000. The decision to send more troops to Germany has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that it will enhance security in Europe and improve the United States' ability to respond quickly to any potential threats. Others, however, have criticized the decision, saying that it will unnecessarily strain US-German relations and contribute to increased tensions with Russia. The deployment of additional troops to Germany is just one part of the US military's larger effort to modernize and strengthen its presence in Europe. This includes increasing funding for military infrastructure, expanding training and exercises with European partners, and enhancing its ability to rapidly deploy forces in times of crisis. The move to send 1,500 more soldiers to Germany is expected to be completed by late 2020, and will mark the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the role of American military forces in Europe. As the United States continues to navigate a complex global landscape, it remains to be seen what impact this deployment will have on its relations with key allies and competitors alike.",ai_generated

"President Obama’s Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced a new plan for U.S. and Afghan military operations in Afghanistan. But one of the biggest questions is what is happening in the Afghan provinces of Helmand and Helmandistan, where troops are dying as more and more troops are being sent into the region.In a news conference, Mr. Panetta explained that the mission in Helmand was expanded because the American military had “cautious optimism” about the local population.A report by the Pentagon said that in Helmand, at the end of March, American and Afghan forces killed more than 150 Taliban, and arrested more than 40 of its leaders, including several major commanders.The number of Afghan troops captured in Helmand is believed to be in the hundreds rather than thousands, but if the Pentagon’s figures are true it still would put thousands more Afghan troops than the thousands who have been caught. That would suggest an ongoing campaign. The Obama administration denies that it is engaged in a campaign. But Secretary Panetta’s assertion that more troops are not being sent is significant.In the Helmand Province, a reporter for the International Herald Tribune asked Pentagon spokesman Col. James Barber about the number of Afghan troops killed or captured. The interview was published on the site of the Herald Tribune. Mr. Barber responded: “We don’t give you numbers as we don’t provide you with those kinds of figures.”Secretary Panetta’s statement does not imply an actual change in U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan.

"2015 is proving to be the year of change for the Panama Canal. After years of planning, the Canal is in the midst of the largest expansion project in its history. The $5.2 billion investment promises to double the cargo capacity of the Canal by adding two new lock chambers and a new third lane of traffic, which will be capable of handling ships carrying up to 13,000 containers. The Canal’s third set of locks, scheduled to open next spring, will have a significant impact on world trade. It will also present new challenges and opportunities for ports as trade patterns change to accommodate more goods shipped through the Canal.In a new report, Making the Most of the Panama Canal Expansion, World Bank senior economist Michelle Ruta explores the project’s expected impact on the maritime sector and the implications for Panama and the rest of the world. “One of the most immediate effects of the Panama Canal expansion is the need for larger locks, taller cranes and deeper channels,” according to Ruta. “Making the appropriate investments to facilitate this traffic is the most efficient way to accommodate ships that are projected to carry up to 18,000 TEUs. Ports that are prepared to handle this traffic are likely to be the big winners.”The report also highlights new risks to ports resulting from the expanded Panama Canal. “As shipping becomes more consolidated around larger container ships, the consequences of delays at ports and other choke points in the supply chain will increase, amplifying the costs of congestion at individual ports,” Ruta explains. “The increased cost of delays will create powerful incentives to reduce congestion and improve efficiency, which will be increasingly important as the industry faces a capacity crunch on both land and sea.”As the Canal expansion nears completion, ports and port operators around the world have an opportunity to attract new business from the larger ships transiting the Canal.",ai_generated

This was seen as an effective border control system. However a lot of people did not know about it at all. Some people thought it was a wall that was built up after Hitler became Chancellor. The wall could have never been taken down and even if it had been taken down, it would have not been restored to be as tight of a border as it was before the Wall went up. The wall also prevented East German refugees from leaving the country.The wall was used as a base for some other structures and there were many more people who thought that Berlin was also a wall. These people believe the wall was necessary for a new border, but that the building of it was a waste of money.On October 5th, 1945 a major air attack on Berlin took place. This attack was a military counterstrike against the German army. It was a total disaster for Germany. In the immediate aftermath of this attack, the German government attempted to bring back the Wall and make it more effective. Hitler wanted a border that would be more effective against the Russians. This was not possible.People in the Berlin district believed that Hitler’s goal was to build a wall that would take on the shape of the Berlin Wall. When he was killed in 1945, this did not happen. In fact, the Wall in Berlin was brought down and rebuilt. There was even an attempt to use it as a defense against a possible Soviet invasion.",ai_generated

"In an effort to revive the French economy and restore public trust, President Emmanuel Macron has announced a series of tax cuts and economic reforms. The president, whose approval ratings have recently taken a hit, unveiled these new measures as part of a major strategy to mitigate the ongoing social and political unrest in the country.The tax cuts, which are set to benefit both households and businesses, come in response to widespread dissatisfaction with the current economic climate, demonstrated by the longstanding 'Yellow Vest' protests. Many French citizens have become increasingly disillusioned with the president's policies, perceiving them as favoring the wealthy and leaving the middle and working classes behind.Among the proposed tax cuts is a €5 billion ($5.6 billion) reduction in income tax, targeting middle-class households in particular. Additionally, the government plans to eliminate the residence tax for 80% of French households by 2020. President Macron believes that these measures will increase purchasing power and stimulate economic growth.Furthermore, the proposed economic reforms include plans to incentivize businesses to create more jobs by reducing employer payroll taxes and streamlining labor regulations. This is expected to boost France's competitiveness on the global stage and promote a more dynamic and inclusive labor market.To finance these tax cuts and economic measures, the French government will pursue spending cuts and reallocation of resources, emphasizing efficiency and minimizing bureaucracy. Critics, however, argue that the planned tax cuts may not be sufficient to address the deep-rooted economic issues facing the country, and that more comprehensive measures need to be implemented.The 'Yellow Vest' protests, which began in November 2018, have grown from initial demonstrations against fuel tax hikes to a broader movement demanding economic justice and political change. This social unrest has prompted President Macron to reconsider his policy approach and launch a nationwide debate to better understand and address the concerns of the French population.Despite the proposed tax cuts and reforms, the success of this new strategy remains to be seen. However, President Macron's latest efforts signal a willingness to listen and adapt to the needs of the people, a significant step towards rebuilding public trust and fostering national unity.",ai_generated

Experts say it is too early to tell whether or not the campaign has been effective.Military combat is not the only way Washington hopes to overcome Iraqi troops. The U.S. military also has been busy trying to persuade Iraqis to give themselves up voluntarily through a psychological operations, or psy-ops, campaign.Part of the campaign involves propaganda radio messages, as well as e-mail and telephone calls to unit commanders inviting them to negotiate their surrenders. Another important component is the dropping of millions of leaflets into Iraq. Some urge Iraqi troops to surrender or face possible destruction. Others tell ordinary civilians not to hurt their own economic futures by damaging oil fields.Brigadier General Vincent Brooks says the psy-ops campaign this time has been more intense than during the first Gulf war in 1991. ""That accounts for roughly five million more [leaflets] than all of which were dropped in Desert Storm,"" he says. ""Each one of them has a different theme. It's targeted to specific areas -- whether it's to a unit or to the population.""The obvious question is has this psy-ops campaign been effective?Professor Jerrold Post, director of George Washington University's Political Psychology Program, says it is too early to say.

"As economies worldwide begin to recover from the economic downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, officials from major financial institutions are now signaling that global markets seem ready for an interest rate hike. The potential increase in interest rates comes amid growing inflationary pressures and the need to maintain financial stability.Interest rates have remained near historic lows since the onset of the pandemic, as central banks worldwide sought to provide stimulus to national economies grappling with the health crisis. However, as economic activity picks up and inflation concerns grow, many experts believe the time is now ripe for a gradual increase in interest rates.John Smith, a senior economist at a leading global financial institution, said, ""We are now witnessing a marked rebound in the global economy.

The individual, whose identity has not been released, is the latest in a series of detentions that have heightened diplomatic tensions between China and Canada.This news comes on the heels of the arrest of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, who were detained in China earlier this month on similar charges. The detentions are widely seen as a retaliatory move by Beijing following the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on December 1st at the request of the United States.The Canadian government confirmed the detention of the third citizen, but has not provided further details about the individual, citing privacy concerns. Global Affairs Canada, the country's foreign affairs department, issued a statement saying they are providing consular assistance to the detainee's family and are in contact with Chinese authorities.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying claimed that the latest detention is unrelated to the cases of Kovrig and Spavor. Hua reiterated that China has been following the law in handling these cases and that the rights of the detained Canadians have been guaranteed.However, the series of detentions has raised concerns about the safety of Canadians in China and has exacerbated already strained relations between the two countries. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the arrests ""arbitrary"" and urged the Chinese government to release Kovrig and Spavor.Despite these incidents, China continues to demand the release of Meng Wanzhou, who faces extradition to the United States on charges of fraud and violating US sanctions against Iran.

Unlike radio carbon dating, this method can be used on mineral pigments like those in the caves.

"European Union lawmakers have given their backing to a proposed ban on a range of disposable plastic products, in a move hailed as a major step forward in the fight against pollution.The law, which is due to come into effect in the coming years, will prohibit the production, sale, and use of a range of single-use plastic items, including drinking straws, cotton buds, and plates and cutlery.The legislation, which was approved by a large majority in the European Parliament on Thursday, has been welcomed by environmental groups, who say that it will help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean and other natural habitats.According to the European Commission, some 8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped into the ocean every year, and the EU hopes to play its part in reducing this figure.The ban, which was proposed by the European Commission in May 2018, is part of a wider effort by the EU to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable production and consumption.It is also expected to spur innovation in the development of alternatives to disposable plastic products, and to support the growth of the circular economy, in which waste is minimized and materials are kept in use for as long as possible.Critics of the ban, however, argue that it could have unintended consequences, such as hitting small businesses harder than larger ones, and that it may not be effective in reducing overall plastic use.The ban will now need to be formally adopted by the Council of the European Union before it can become law, but this is seen as a formality, given the support it has received in the Parliament.The European Commission has said that it expects the legislation to come into effect in the coming years, and that it will work with member states to ensure a smooth transition to a plastic-free future.",ai_generated

"As the second day of nuclear disarmament talks began here in Beijing, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei called on all participants to use their ""utmost political courage"" to achieve progress.The talks, aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, opened Tuesday with several delegates expressing a sense of purpose.North Korea said it is prepared to work toward denuclearization, while the United States said it would take corresponding measures in return.But both Washington and Pyongyang want the other to make the first move. Christopher Hill, the lead U.S. delegate, said the North Koreans have expressed concern about the sequence of events. ""They do not want to have obligations ahead of other people's obligations,"" he said.Chinese officials say there are ""hard issues"" on the agenda this time, unlike at the first three rounds of talks, which ended inconclusively.North Korea demands energy aid, security guarantees and diplomatic recognition from the United States in exchange for disarmament. Washington wants North Korea to verifiably and irreversibly end its nuclear weapons programs before Pyongyang receives any incentives.South Korea has separately offered to supply all of the North's electricity needs if the North abandons its nuclear programs. North Korea has yet to respond to that offer.Ralph Cossa, a North Korea expert with the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, agrees that it will be a question of which side moves first.",human

But most of the time, when the police brings the ISIS people to justice, either the prosecutor refuses to write an indictment or the courts let these people go on account that not enough evidence being found, which tells you where the priorities of Turkish state lie.""

"The criminalization of the use of social media in the country is generating intense debate in Angola. The phenomenon of the Internet, which has evolved as one of the major media, has divided opinions between advocates and critics. Many believe that social networks should be used as information tools, to exchange ideas and to stimulate innovation. Others think that social networks are not ideal for political debate and should be used moderately. The Angolan government took a different approach to the problem and decided to criminalize the use of social networks. This measure has been heavily criticized by political opponents and by the human rights community, who view the legislation as excessive and a violation of fundamental rights of expression. As a result, the debate about criminalizing the use of social media in Angola is not diminishing and continues to generate controversy. The government says it's working to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equitably.",machine_translated
"Iraq's southern city of Basra has been hit by a rare double car bombing, with at least 10 people killed and 16 others wounded. The most serious attack happened Sunday at a bus terminal in a town on the outskirts of Basra. Provincial security committee chief Ali al-Maliki said 10 people were killed. Minutes earlier, another car bomb exploded in a parking lot in central Basra, wounding several people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in and around the normally-peaceful port city, which is predominantly Shi'ite. Minority Sunni militants linked to al-Qaida frequently attack Shi'ite targets to try to undermine the government of Shi'ite Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Many Iraqi Sunnis have been staging protests against Mr. Maliki in recent months, accusing him of discriminating against their community. Al-Qaida has been trying to exploit that discontent to trigger a sectarian civil war.",human

"Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the MDC, has taken legal action against the country's electoral laws, arguing that they are biased and unfair. The party has filed a constitutional court challenge against the laws, which were recently amended by the ruling ZANU-PF party.The MDC argues that the changes to the electoral laws, which were made in August, are aimed at ensuring that the ruling party retains power in the forthcoming general election, scheduled for next year. The party's legal challenge comes just a week after the country's top court ruled that candidates in the election must have at least a high school education, a move that the MDC says is discriminatory.The MDC's legal challenge is seen as a test case for democracy in Zimbabwe, where the ruling party has been accused of suppressing opposition voices. The party's leader, Nelson Chamisa, has vowed to fight for a fair and free election, and has urged other opposition parties to join the legal challenge.Zimbabwe's electoral laws have been a source of controversy in the past, with the MDC alleging widespread fraud in the last election in 2018.

"NAIROBI - The Central Bank of Kenya is cracking down on commercial banks accused of illegal lending practices. Police issued arrest warrants Friday for eight bankers for alleged unethical conduct. Since becoming governor at Kenya’s Central Bank, Patrick Njoroge has led a charge against improper lending practices in the commercial banking sector. In the past year, the Central Bank has put three commercial institutions under receivership, which means that a government-appointed agency takes over the running of the bank. The most recent bank targeted was Chase Bank last week. The news caused a run on the bank as people frantically tried to withdraw their money. Chase Bank is currently closed. The central bank governor sought to reassure Kenyans late Sunday. Njoroge said the Central Bank would provide credit to financial institutions to meet their obligations. “We will avail a facility to any bank or any microfinance institution that comes under liquidity pressures arising from no fault of their own. We will avail this facility for as long as necessary to return stability and confidence to the Kenyan financial sector,” said Njoroge. He said withdrawals from those banks would be limited to $1,000. In the case of Chase, industry experts say they expect outside investors to buy up shares and bail the bank out.
